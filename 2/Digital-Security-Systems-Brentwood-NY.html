<p>Some smart alarms include or can be utilized with wifi security cameras from the very same maker. Not only do these act as motion sensors however they enable you to see what's happening in your home if the alarm has been activated, so you'll understand if it's an incorrect alarm or a genuine emergency.

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only an incorrect sense of security given that it prevents just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
