<p>According to a report, homes that do not have a security system are 3 times most likely to be robbed. Brinks owns and runs its own US-based monitoring center. Its monitoring service includes a benefit called ASAPer, which all at once messages a group of pre-set contacts to identify whether alarm activity is a true emergency situation or incorrect alarm. A lot of monitoring center call household members one at a time, which can slow reaction times.</p>
<p>Years ago, all alarm required you to have a landline phone and that landline was used to link your security system to the monitoring center and there weren't any other options. However, today, many people do not even have a landline phone since they use their mobile phones for whatever.
