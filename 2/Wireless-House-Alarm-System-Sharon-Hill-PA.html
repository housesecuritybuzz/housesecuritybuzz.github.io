<p>The downside to a wireless system is that it depends on a wireless signal, suggesting that storms and strong winds have the power to disrupt the system and might even trigger incorrect alarms. Incorrect alarms are understood to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might result in fines from the provider or the police if they take place often enough. Another prospective downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool should be replaced or charged routinely in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can likewise be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is generally offset by the fact that there are no installation costs.</p>
