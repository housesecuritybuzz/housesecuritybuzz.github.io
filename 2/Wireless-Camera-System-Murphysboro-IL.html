<p>Even though 1080p is typically the standard resolution for cameras we have actually evaluated, there are advantages to designs with higher-resolution sensors. Few home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, but almost all have digital zoom, which crop and expand whatever the camera is tape-recording. The more megapixels a camera sensor has, the more you can digitally zoom in and still have the ability to see things clearly.</p>
<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it provides protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to discover it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect complacency because it avoids just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
