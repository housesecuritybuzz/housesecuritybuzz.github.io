<p>The Frontpoint Security system, in addition to its Interactive plan, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and functions are nearly identical to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's strategies are slightly more pricey for the exact same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation fees are difficult, and its prices is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyway.</p>
<p>You'll get up-to-date equipment from Link Interactive and a highly-rated mobile app. Unlike some other home security companies, Link Interactive provides as much as 48 sensing units in its basic package, consisting of both fire and CO alarms.
