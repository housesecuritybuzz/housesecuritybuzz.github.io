<p>Absolutely nothing is more vital than safeguarding what you treasure most ... your family and home. You do not have to buy a multi-million dollar surveillance system to watch on your property and possessions. In the event that your alarm system is triggered, your home security system sends a wireless alert to the monitoring company where security professionals are standing by to respond by instantly contacting you and if requirement be, the regional medical, fire or police authorities.</p>

<p>To determine response times for the monitoring company, we activated each system a minimum of 5 times, using contact and motion sensing units. Nevertheless, keep in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has definitely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they respond at all.

Commercial cameras surpass their less expensive cousins since they have larger internal video sensors and higher-quality parts that can adjust and capture outstanding low light video.</p>
