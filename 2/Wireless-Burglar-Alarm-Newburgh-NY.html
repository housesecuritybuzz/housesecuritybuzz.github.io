<p>Recently, Ring denied reports that it had suffered a data breach, but we concur with its recommendation that users need to reset passwords and make it possible for two-factor authentication as a precautionary procedure. All smart-home devices are vulnerable to such occurrences. However, after this newest entry in a year-long series of controversial media reports, we have decided to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? area from our wise video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video products, we don't think that these issues alter the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain positive in our present recommendation.</p>
