<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can determine individuals the camera is finding utilizing face acknowledgment. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those people and will send out smartphone informs with that info when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate predicted visitors from random complete strangers.
