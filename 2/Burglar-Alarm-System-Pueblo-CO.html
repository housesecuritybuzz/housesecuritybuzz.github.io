<p>No. Monitored medical alarms are not included in this new law. These alarms vary from panic alarms, which are covered. Panic alarms receive authorities action based upon worry of impending injury or bodily harm due to criminal activity, while medical alarms usually get fire action based on an emergency situation due to a pre-existing (doctor-diagnosed) medical condition.</p>
<p>When using IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the big quantity of information required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and typically over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are dependable, but not compatible with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the requirement for further wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may need less electrical wiring in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera independently, normally via 110VAC power. </p>
