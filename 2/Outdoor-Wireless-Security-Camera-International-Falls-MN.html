<p>Another consideration with wireless home security systems is the restricted variety of sensors. A lot of radio frequencies are weak outside a variety of 500 feet. This means that you have to structure your wireless system with this in mind, specifically if your home is larger than 4,500 square feet. When wanting to buy a surveillance camera, there are a couple of elements to think about.</p>
<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>
