<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally regular because the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once consumers recognize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
