<p>Seattle's primary intent with this law is to hold alarm-monitoring companies more liable for false alarms, and lower the variety of unnecessary cops and fire actions.

<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing video footage in the dark is a concern.</p>
