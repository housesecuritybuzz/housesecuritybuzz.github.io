<p>I explained that all we would need to do is use any one of the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which likewise consisted of two-way audio, and that camera would end up being the user interface into the VMS system. When a client pushes the emergency situation button, it sends out dual alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS.

Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be moved. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door permits the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the alarm system will set off.</p>
