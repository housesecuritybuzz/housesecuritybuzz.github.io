<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.

It takes a second for the camera to actually turn on when it spots motion due to the fact that the Pro 2 does not do continuous video recording. If a nefarious wrongdoer was quick enough, they might surpass the camera before it had time to tape-record them.</p>
