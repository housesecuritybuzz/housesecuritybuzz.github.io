We also found the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a nearby TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
