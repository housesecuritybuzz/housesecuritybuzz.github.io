<p>GO2 provides full-service Video Surveillance Installation of hd (HD), IP, digital, outdoor, and wireless Security Camera Systems. ADT's six consumer monitoring centers (more than any other security company has) make sure your security never goes offline. If one monitoring station faces a disruption of service, your home's protection is instantly transferred to another center. Wireless security systems that are technically innovative and more flexible to utilize often have better features than the conventional systems.</p>
<p>The biggest disadvantage of SmartThings is that there's no camera. As such, if an alarm or sensing unit gets activated while you're away, you have no visual ways of validating if something is really wrong and how severe the scenario is. If the alarm incident is identified to be a false alarm, the city will send by mail an invoice summarizing the incident and evaluating a charge, if any.</p>
