<p>The frequency of video surveillance systems as a service (VSSaaS) solution has risen in the last few years. Although local storage is effective in its own respect, it has several caveats.

<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by a professional home security company. When the system discovers a burglary, fire, or other emergency situation, it alerts the security team and, in some cases, emergency responders.
