<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely typical considering that the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as customers realize that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
