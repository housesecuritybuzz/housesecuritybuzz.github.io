<p>B. This chapter governs burglar alarm systems intended to summon cops department workers, requires registration, assessment of fees for extreme false burglar alarms, provides procedures for repeat offenders, and provides an effective date. Another huge feature is night vision. You might also think about a camera with a built-in motion-activated light-- all the much better to terrify you with, my dear!

From there, Alexa will cycle your lights on and off to make it appear like you're home - and you'll likewise get a notice if your Echo speakers hear the sound of an alarm, or damaged glass.</p>
