<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can determine people the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those people and will send out smartphone notifies with that information when they appear at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also offer a larger range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
