In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls should be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires confirmation from a private security personnel. Several cities also need an authorization to even own and operate a home security system. Guidelines such as these are designed to restrict the time and resources that authorities and fire departments waste on false alarms. Many towns will fine you for a lot of incorrect alarms.</p>
