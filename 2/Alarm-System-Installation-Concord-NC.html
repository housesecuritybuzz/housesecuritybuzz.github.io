<p>Also called eyeball" cameras, the turret camera has a ball-and-socket joint to let you exactly redirect the field of view without remounting the security camera whenever. They're great for warehouses.

<p>The drawback? It's very simple to commit security errors that will leave your home susceptible. The moment you drive out of signal range or turn your phone to airplane mode is the minute you have actually left your house open. This gaping hole in your security can show to be a huge problem if you aren't careful. With a monitored system, that wouldn't be a concern. However, with an unmonitored system, it's up to you to call the authorities or other emergency situation services if your home is in threat. Still, the unmonitored system is much less expensive and therefore is still the better option for many who are only concerned about cost. </p>
