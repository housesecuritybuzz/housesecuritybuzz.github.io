<p>We don't advise the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complicated than it needs to be. Recordings, signals, and integration all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
