<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by a professional home security company. When the system finds a break-in, fire, or other emergency, it alerts the security team and, in some cases, emergency responders.

<p>We attempted each of the cameras in several places around our house, varying from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was linked to Verizon Fios service.

Although FrontPoint offers a wide array of equipment and home automation items at a reasonable cost, the one location where the company especially stands out remains in Do It Yourself installation. </p>
