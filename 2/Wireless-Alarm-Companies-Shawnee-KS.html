With most DIY systems, such as the SimpliSafe Home Security Set, the Ring Alarm Security Kit, and the Nest Secure, you buy the hardware outright and can prevent any month-to-month charges if you choose to self-monitor. If you include monitoring, costs will differ: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 each month for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 each month.
