<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.

Nevertheless, after nearly 2 years of use, day and night images have always been clear, and we never ever had problems with the camera missing out on motion, a problem we encountered when evaluating the Wyze Cam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a clever feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It produces a green, on-screen box around the motion detected. We have actually seen it highlight moths, cars, and mice.</p>
