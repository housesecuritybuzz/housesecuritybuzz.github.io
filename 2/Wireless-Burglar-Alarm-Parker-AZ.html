<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it provides protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to identify it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just a false sense of security since it avoids only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
