<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely typical since the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
