<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it offers protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software to find it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only a false sense of security given that it avoids just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
