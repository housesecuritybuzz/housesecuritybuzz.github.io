<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it offers protection only when the wireless device is "off the air".

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only a false sense of security given that it avoids just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
