<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, normally referred to as shock sensing units, are various in that they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and frequently through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>

<p>You can trigger the 80dB alarm if you do encounter a home intrusion emergency situation. I am somewhat disappointed by the volume of the alarm. At 80dB, it has to do with as loud as a food mill whereas lots of other alarm are as loud as 90dB or perhaps 105dB. In spite of that, the alarm must be enough to frighten intruders for the most part. To recover costs and hold alarm companies liable for false alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company should be accredited, pay any registration or false alarm charges, and provide physical proof like camera footage or a damaged window to require cops response.</p>
