<p>Video surveillance is cost scalable and reliable. As your business grows, adding and incorporating additional cameras into an established network is easy and economical. We're also a huge fan of Ring's Neighbors app. This app lets you, your next-door neighbors, and cops send alerts if there's trouble in the area. You can use it even without a Ring alarm, and if you have a Ring camera, you can upload and share clips of suspicious activity or lost pets.</p>

<p>The majority of outdoor cameras, like the Arlo Ultra, offer motion detection with push and e-mail notices, night vision, and cloud storage for event-triggered video, and some, like the Ring Floodlight Cam, pull double responsibility as floodlights or porch lights. Some designs can even tell the difference in between a passing vehicle, an animal, and a person. Search for an outdoor camera that will integrate with other smart home gadgets such as garage door openers, external sirens, and clever switches.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is a strong all-around camera that works inside or out, and it's super easy to install. The most significant disadvantage is the investment. You need to buy a base station in addition to two cameras, that makes the up-front cost more substantial than other cameras. Vivint is an exceptional choice for those looking for a clever home security system that includes affordable, energy-efficient technology.
