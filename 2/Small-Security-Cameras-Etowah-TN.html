<h3>Wireless Alarm Companies in Etowah TN</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.

Although the cost may drive some away, the pros far exceed the cons, especially with the capability to record 2K HDR video, along with an incorporated spotlight and "color" night vision. Plus, the Pro 3 consists of a complimentary Arlo Smart trial, which adds a lot more abilities to this remarkable security camera system.</p>
