<p>All of this will cost you, though: A single camera (with the hub) is $399, and extra cameras are $299 each. The Arlo Ultra does not included a complimentary tier of cloud storage, so you have to invest a minimum of $3 each month if you want to save any videos. And if you wish to conserve 4K videos, it's an additional $1.99 per camera per month, on top of the monthly plan, the latter of which is waived for the first year.

<p>Dome IP camera, as the name suggests, is a type of CCTV camera with a dome cover. But beyond that I simply had problems.

I was performing the macarena in front of the camera for about two minutes before it even saw I was there. </p>
