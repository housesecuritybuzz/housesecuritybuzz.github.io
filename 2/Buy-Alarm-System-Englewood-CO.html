The Ring Stick Up Webcam is available in wired and battery versions, which can be used inside your home and outdoors. But neither can tape continually, and they both need the Ring Secure plan to record recordings. Also, the wired variation typically left spaces of up to 7 seconds in between 1-minute recordings, while the battery variation left about a minute in between 30-second clips. Both also do not have person detection and geofencing, which other cameras use to minimize false alerts.</p>
<p>Cameras typically broadcast footage online, permitting operators to monitor security camera feeds from another location.
