<h3>Video Surveillance System Ely NV 89301</h3>
<p>There is a new pattern in surveillance video search innovation that is quickly changing the security market, and it is called Deep Knowing". What is Deep Knowing and why is it so important?  For starters, Deep Knowing allows someone to find what they are trying to find without having to search through hours of worthless video footage.  Think of a web page that works a lot like a Google search, where you can describe the components you are trying to find in the tape-recorded video footage.  For instance, if we require to see all video from today that has a police vehicle in it, we merely type authorities" into the search window and in seconds every key frame of video with a patrol car appears.  With deep knowing video search, you now have an effective service for catching crooks and gathering evidence.</p>
<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see in the evening. If catching video footage in the dark is a priority, ensure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
