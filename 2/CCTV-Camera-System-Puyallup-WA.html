<p>Different types of CCTV cameras. All of the cameras were simple to install. Each camera has an app that strolls you through the setup process. This normally includes finding a spot for your camera, creating an account in the app, and connecting the camera to your Wi-Fi network. Many of them then allow you to configure the alert frequency and produce activity monitoring zones, so the camera will catch motion only in designated areas-- a feature we discover needed for high-traffic locations, which might set off a lot of false signals.</p>
<p>After evaluating dozens of wired and wireless options, the best home security camera for most people is the Arlo Pro 2. It records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is completely wireless, and can be established both indoors and out, as it's weather condition resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have an agreement, and its equipment pricing is super sensible, so it's not a total splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>
