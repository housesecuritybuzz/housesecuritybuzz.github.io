<p>If I liked the appearance of the Nest, then I love the Hive View's design - surely the most visually pleasing camera on this list. The handsome glossy black cube, magnetically attached to a brushed metal stand (mine can be found in a lovely rose-gold however you can also get it in silver) strikes the perfect balance between subtle and attractive adequate to not draw attention to itself.</p>

We initially saw Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E Once we attempted it out, it quickly became a staff (and friends and family) favorite. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send out notifies, you can't control it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
