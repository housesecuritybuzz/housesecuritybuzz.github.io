<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is an enjoyment to use also (a lot much better than the apps you get with some budget security cameras), though if you want to get into its cleverest customisations, there is a bit of a knowing curve. For even more basic smarts, it's great, though.

<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it provides protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software application to spot it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only a false sense of security since it prevents only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>

<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by an expert home security company.
