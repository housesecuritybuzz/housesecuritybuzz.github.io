<p>Seattle's primary intent with this law is to hold alarm-monitoring companies more responsible for false alarms, and reduce the number of unneeded police and fire reactions. Alarm monitoring companies are the specialists and should be teaching their clients how to properly set and care for their alarm systems.

Alarm-monitoring companies have taken pleasure in the benefit of police response to their clients' alarms without any accountability for the accuracy or reliability of those alarms.</p>
