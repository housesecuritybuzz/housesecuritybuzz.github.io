<p>An on-site ringer will generally trigger a bell or siren connected to the structure when the alarm is tripped. Similarly, when an automated dialer alarm is tripped, a phone call is instantly placed to the authorities or fire departments, and a pre-recorded announcement is played when that call is answered. Automatic dialer alarms are not allowed to dial 9-1-1.</p>
<p>Just recently, Ring denied reports that it had suffered a data breach, but we concur with its suggestion that users must reset passwords and enable two-factor authentication as a preventive step. All smart-home devices are vulnerable to such incidents. Nevertheless, after this most current entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have decided to pull our suggestion of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially check out the What about Ring? area from our smart video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it concerns video products, we do not believe that these issues alter the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain positive in our current suggestion.</p>
