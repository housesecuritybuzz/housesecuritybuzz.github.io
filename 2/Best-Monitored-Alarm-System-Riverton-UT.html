<p>The very best in clever home security systems. Life can get chaotic often, and it can be hard keeping an eye on whatever around you. Fortunately, a surveillance camera can lend an additional pair of eyes and serve as lookout for you and your household.

<p>A system that needs a contract may be a smart choice for those who are cash-strapped or do not want to spend for the equipment up-front. Why?

We've seen 1-year, all the way as much as 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you don't wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term agreement (and who does?). Our choice: No contract.</p>
