<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can determine people the camera is identifying utilizing face acknowledgment. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those individuals and will send out mobile phone informs with that information when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to differentiate anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also offer a broader variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
