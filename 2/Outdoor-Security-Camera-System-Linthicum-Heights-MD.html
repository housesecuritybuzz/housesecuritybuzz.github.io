When the magnet is moved far from the reed switch, the reed switch either closes or opens, once again based on whether the style is usually open or generally closed.

We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also pestered with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (up to 30 seconds) to connect to a live peek, typically buffered, and had a reset function that left spaces of approximately 90 seconds in between videos.</p>
