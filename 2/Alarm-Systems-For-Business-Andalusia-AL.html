It tape-records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is totally wireless, and can be set up both inside your home and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint doesn't have an agreement, and its equipment pricing is very affordable, so it's not an overall splurge. However you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>

<p>We liked Alder for their fast response times and general versatility. And managing our system with their touchscreen panel was effortless and quite darn streamlined. Otherwise, this company offers a comparable feature-set as brands like Frontpoint and Brinks. With the quality of the equipment that is readily available today, it's safe to say that the wireless systems are just as good, if not much better, than the wired systems. Provided all of the other advantages, it's easy to see why so many people are choosing this choice. </p>
