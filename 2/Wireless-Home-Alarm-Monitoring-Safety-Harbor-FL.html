<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a malicious aggressor, since the disruption of the network avoids the flow of information and actually indirectly secures information by avoiding it from being transmitted. The normal reason for performing a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, providing an opportunity for the harmful aggressor to record these codes and utilize different breaking tools to analyze security weaknesses and exploit them to gain unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools available which can introduce a dictionary style attack of "perhaps accepted" security keys based on the "design" security crucial caught throughout the network recovery.</p>
