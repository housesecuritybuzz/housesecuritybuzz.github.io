<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that compare individuals and general motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
