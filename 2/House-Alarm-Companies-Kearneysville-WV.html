<p>A tight wire border security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to find any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to disregard things that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is installed to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
