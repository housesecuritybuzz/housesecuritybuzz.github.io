<p>Your CCTV camera might make you feel physically more secure, but after reading this post, it will sure make you feel essentially susceptible. A couple of minutes into the DIY installation, our tester got stuck getting her control board up and online-- it simply would not connect. An aid window popped up with a number to call, and a Frontpoint representative helped her troubleshoot the connection. After about 10 minutes, he might inform there was a concern with the circuit board. Certainly not perfect-- but the rep asked forgiveness and delivered her replacement control panel overnight.</p>
<p>After evaluating lots of wired and wireless options, the best home security camera for most people is the Arlo Pro 2. It records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is completely wireless, and can be set up both inside and out, as it's weather condition resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint doesn't have an agreement, and its equipment rates is super sensible, so it's not an overall splurge. However you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the similarity Vivint or Brinks.</p>
