<p>The Hive View delivers terrific 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation set off too quickly, even when on the lowest sensitivity setting.

<p>It's not practically security from theft, either. Adam Kostecki, the senior assistant vice president of digital services and innovation at Amica, advises sensors that concentrate on things you wouldn't otherwise see, like leak sensing units or freeze sensors.
