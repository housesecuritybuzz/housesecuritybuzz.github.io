<p>The rate of admission for the Deep Sentinel Home Security system isn't that steep, even at $499, since it includes three outdoor cameras with two-way audio. And the $50-per-month subscription cost sounds expensive, however it's not a lot when you consider that a live person is viewing a live feed whenever the cameras find suspicious activity. That person at Deep Guard's facility can caution a suspicious person that they're being observed, and they can call your local authorities dispatcher if they decline to leave or engage in a criminal act. It's not for everyone, but it's the best DIY outdoor security camera we've seen to date.</p>

It likewise had the quietest alarm of all that we evaluated and there's no external monitoring service readily available.</p>
