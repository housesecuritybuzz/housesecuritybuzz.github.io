<h3>Surveillance Camera System Lafayette CA 94549</h3>

As our officers respond to reports of criminal activity in our neighborhood, they might have the ability to utilize the information or footage captured on these security cameras to assist in the apprehension and prosecution of the criminals involved.</p>
<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
<p>We have actually evaluated numerous important reasons why one need to consider commercial-grade cameras up until now, however, we have simply skimmed the surface of the topic. In today's network-connected world, a surveillance system is rarely a stand-alone system. It is worth knowing if your proposed camera system will integrate with other products. </p>
