<p>Xfinity Home Refund Policy for Pre-Payments: If you make a pre-payment previous to installation of your Xfinity Home service, such pre-payment will be used as a credit to charges due on the following month's bill from Comcast. In case you cancel your Xfinity Home service, your pre-payment will be applied rather to any other charges due on your costs for Comcast services. You will not receive a cash or charge card refund of your pre-payment. Nevertheless, if all of your services from Comcast are disconnected, or if Comcast is otherwise required under appropriate law to refund the pre-payment, Comcast will, within forty-five (45) days or as otherwise specified by applicable law, return an amount equal to the pre-payments your made (without interest unless otherwise needed by law) minus any amounts due on your account (including, without restriction, any amounts owed for any services or for any equipment that is damaged, changed or not returned).</p>

<p>You can trigger the 80dB alarm if you do experience a home invasion emergency situation. I am somewhat disappointed by the volume of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food processor whereas numerous other alarm are as loud as 90dB or perhaps 105dB. Regardless of that, the alarm ought to suffice to scare away burglars in most cases. To recoup expenses and hold alarm companies accountable for incorrect alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company rather of with you. Your alarm company must be certified, pay any registration or false alarm charges, and offer physical proof like camera video or a damaged window to require police response.</p>

<p>The cover of darkness isn't sufficient to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view. The one time where lag does end up being a bit of a problem is in between finding and recording motion. Because the Pro 2 doesn't do constant video recording, it takes a 2nd for the camera to in fact switch on when it spots motion. They could get past the camera before it had time to record them if a nefarious lawbreaker was fast enough.</p>
