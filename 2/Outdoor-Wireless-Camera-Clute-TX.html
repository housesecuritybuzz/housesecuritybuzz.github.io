<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it offers protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software application to detect it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety.
