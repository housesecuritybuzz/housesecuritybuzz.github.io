<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can identify individuals the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name.

We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to identify anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also offer a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
