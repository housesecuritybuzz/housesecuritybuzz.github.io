<h3>Surveillance Camera System West Bend WI 53095</h3>
<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to sign in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We first saw Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E Once we attempted it out, it quickly ended up being a staff (and friends and family) favorite. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send informs, you can't manage it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
