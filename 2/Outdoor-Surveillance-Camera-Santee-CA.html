<p>We like all the features the Kasa Area uses that make it such outstanding value and among the best security cameras on the market: two-way audio, night vision, 1080p HD recording, customized activity zones and more.

<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive strategy, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and functions are nearly identical to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's strategies are somewhat more costly for the very same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation costs are difficult, and its rates is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyhow.</p>
