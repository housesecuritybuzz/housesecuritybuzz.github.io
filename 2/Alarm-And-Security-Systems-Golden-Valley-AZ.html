<p>Up until now so normal. Things start to get actually fascinating with the Nest's facial acknowledgment system. If the camera spots a face it doesn't recognise, it will send an alert and picture to your phone, enabling you to give that individual the once over.

We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish predicted visitors from random strangers.
