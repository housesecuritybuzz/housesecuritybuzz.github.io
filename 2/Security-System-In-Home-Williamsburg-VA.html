<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously excellent piece of technology. For beginners, it looks gorgeous: the all-white design and black camera face are seriously spacey (if strangely similar to the AI in 2001: A Space Odyssey).

The very first wireless function to consider is the security system and its parts, and how they all link. In the past, every monitoring element was hard-wired back to a panel box. This indicated every door and window required its own wire and course of holes through your house.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely regular because the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once customers understand that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
<p>We liked Alder for their fast response times and total adaptability. And managing our system with their touchscreen panel was uncomplicated and quite darn streamlined. Otherwise, this company uses a comparable feature-set as brand names like Frontpoint and Brinks. With the quality of the equipment that is offered today, it's safe to say that the wireless systems are just as good, if not much better, than the wired systems. Given all of the other advantages, it's easy to see why a lot of people are choosing this option. </p>
