<p>While you have to pay for cloud video storage on the Arlo Pro 3, it's one of the more affordable subscriptions out there at $2.99 a month. This is an expensive security camera, but we believe it deserves the investment.

Many sites requiring alarm installations no longer have traditional telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with conventional telephone dialer capability do not work dependably over some types of VoIP service.</p>

It costs a lot, its pricing isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to mention that the client service experience differs extensively depending upon the dealer you go with. </p>
