<h2>Video Surveillance Distributor Woodward</h2>
<p>In the past, a surveillance security system normally included a number of cameras connected-- either hardwired or wireless-- to a digital video recorder (DVR), which taped the images and showed them on a closed circuit tv (CCTV) or monitor. Nowadays, it's much easier to have a standalone security camera. Whether you have one camera or numerous, they deal with your home's internet network to send out video footage right to your computer system or mobile device.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
