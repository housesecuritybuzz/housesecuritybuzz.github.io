We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise discovered the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise supply a broader variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
