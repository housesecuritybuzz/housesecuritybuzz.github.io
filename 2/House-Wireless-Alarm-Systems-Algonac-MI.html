<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to check in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We initially observed Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it rapidly became a staff (and friends and family) favorite. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker.

Unless you just have one door and one window, you'll need more than the lone contact sensing unit that is available in Ring's five-piece set.</p>
