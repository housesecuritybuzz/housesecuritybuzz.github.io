<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>

It costs a lot, its prices isn't always transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to mention that the customer care experience varies commonly depending upon the dealer you go with. </p>
