<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your home so we might point them at the very same spot and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had installed on the porch by a licensed electrical expert (who takes place to be my hubby). All of the cameras were linked to the exact same 2.4 GHz network by means of a Wi-Fi router indoors (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to your house was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>We tried each of the cameras in several places around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was connected to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we evaluated each camera utilizing an iOS gadget (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) along with an Android mobile phone (utilizing a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint uses a wide array of equipment and home automation products at a reasonable price, the one location where the company especially stands out remains in Do It Yourself installation. </p>
