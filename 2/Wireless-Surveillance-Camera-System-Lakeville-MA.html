<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to check in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We first discovered Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it rapidly ended up being a personnel (and family and friends) fave. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send signals, you can't manage it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>

However, there were some problems with connecting the command hub to our tester's network. </p>
