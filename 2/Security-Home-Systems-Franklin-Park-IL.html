<p>The Blink XT2 is small, runs on two AA batteries, and consists of a year's worth of free cloud storage, and it captures a better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smartphone alerts and live views were painfully sluggish, and the range is poor. Also, if the camera remains in the middle of recording, don't expect to get a live peek or make any settings modifications-- it can't multitask.</p>
