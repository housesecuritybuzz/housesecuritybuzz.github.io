When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally normal because the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once consumers realize that the affordable customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
