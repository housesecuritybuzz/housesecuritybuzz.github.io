<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to check in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We first observed Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it rapidly became a staff (and friends and family) favorite. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send notifies, you can't control it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
