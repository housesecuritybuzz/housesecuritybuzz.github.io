<p>If you do encounter a home invasion emergency, you can trigger the 80dB alarm. I am somewhat dissatisfied by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it has to do with as loud as a food mill whereas lots of other alarm are as loud as 90dB and even 105dB. Regardless of that, the alarm should be enough to scare away burglars in many cases.

<p>The Ring Floodlight Webcam integrates 2 essential devices in one: A home security camera and a motion-activated floodlight. When the Floodlight camera identifies motion, it switches on its two powerful LED beams along with its sharp 1080p camera, and starts recording. The Floodlight Web cam likewise has a loud speaker, so you can talk to whoever's in front of the camera, and hear their actions.</p>
<p>What to consider: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 per month, however you'll pay a little bit more if you want to add additional features, like a security camera. While a common contract runs 42 months (among the longer contract terms on our list), that requirement is just for users who wish to lease their equipment. Vivint has no minimum contract requirement if you buy your equipment upfront.</p>
<p>Scout Alarm ties with Ring for the most cost-efficient monitoring plan beginning at $10. You can get all the basics like email, sms, and push alerts, as well as 4G LTE cellular backup and battery for Scout's least expensive, Always On" strategy. Nevertheless, you will need to pay for extra $2.99 cloud camera storage (per camera) monthly, and this doesn't come with professional monitoring. This additional cost isn't perfect, but when compared to the Frontpoint and Vivint $40-and $45- particular minimum prices each month for monitoring, Scout Alarm is a take. </p>
