The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting components, which I had set up on the patio by a licensed electrical contractor (who occurs to be my partner). All of the cameras were connected to the same 2.4 GHz network through a Wi-Fi router indoors (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>We tried each of the cameras in numerous locations around our house, varying from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was linked to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we evaluated each camera using an iOS device (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) in addition to an Android mobile phone (utilizing a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint provides a wide variety of equipment and home automation items at a reasonable rate, the one location where the company especially excels is in DIY installation. </p>
