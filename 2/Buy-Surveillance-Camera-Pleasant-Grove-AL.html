<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, normally referred to as shock sensors, are various in that they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn produce an alarm condition.</p>

<h3>Motion Activated Security Camera in Pleasant Grove AL</h3>

<p>So why do not we rank ADT greater? In some ways, ADT annoys us. We see so many growing companies branching off and trying new things in the home security area. However ADT isn't keeping up. It costs a lot, its pricing isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to mention that the customer care experience varies commonly depending upon the dealer you go with. </p>
