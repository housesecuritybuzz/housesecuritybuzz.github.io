Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn produce an alarm condition.</p>

<p>So why do not we rank ADT greater? In some ways, ADT annoys us. We see so many growing companies branching off and trying new things in the home security area. However ADT isn't keeping up. It costs a lot, its pricing isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to mention that the customer care experience varies commonly depending upon the dealer you go with. </p>
