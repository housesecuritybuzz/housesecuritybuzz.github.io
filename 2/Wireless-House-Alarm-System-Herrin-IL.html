<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product category is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security experts investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. The smart bit is that the camera not only identifies that people have entered its 130-degree visual field, however it will also have a stab at identifying them too. Perhaps more usefully, if someone passes who the camera does not know, you get an alert about an "unidentified face". You can inform the system who it is (if it's not an intruder), and next time around it ought to automatically understand.</p>
<p>The other significant decision when selecting a home security camera is whether you require an indoor or outdoor  camera. Outdoor cameras will frequently be developed to be more able and long lasting to make it through rain, frost, or damp. The disadvantage of outdoor cameras is that they're generally mains powered and need expert installation. Luckily, I have actually checked out dozens of cameras and condensed whatever I have actually learned into the list below.

Let's dive in.</p>

<p>Analog security cameras send lower resolution video over coax cable television and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can manage such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom.

Displays can be connected to the DVR for viewing, or the system can be set up to interact through network or mobile app for seeing.</p>

The one time where lag does become a little bit of an issue is between identifying and recording movement.

They might get past the camera prior to it had time to tape-record them if a wicked criminal was quick enough.</p>
