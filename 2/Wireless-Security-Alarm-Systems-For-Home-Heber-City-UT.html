On the other hand, bullet-shaped cameras are more common. They have a cylinder shape that clearly sticks out to alert thieves that your home is under surveillance.</p>
<p>There's a few other cool features in the camera itself such as an automatic zoom which tracks moving items if it discovers an intruder; a handy intercom function that enables the device to serve as a smart doorbell (although it does not have a chime or button - for that you'll need the Nest Hello doorbell ); and, considering that Alphabet owns Nest, the camera brings Google Assistant.</p>

And while this is a quite standard function in indoor cameras, two-way audio is relatively unusual in outdoor security cameras.</p>
