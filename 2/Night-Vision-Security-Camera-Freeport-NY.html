We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a nearby TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also supply a larger range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
