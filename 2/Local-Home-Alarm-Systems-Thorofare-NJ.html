IP cameras also have extra features that analog cameras do not provide, such as video analytics, which allow for mobile alerts and automatic recording if there is motion within the camera's field of vision. This is particularly helpful for times when your business is closed and you want to know if someone is walking around inside the premises. You can set up the system to flag events like this and send notifications directly to your smart device, in addition to taped footage of the event.
