<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most technically advanced outdoor camera we have actually checked. It has a close-up tracking function, which automatically focuses on motion and then follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare basic motion and people, so it reduces incorrect alarms, and it can even recognize individuals you have actually identified (after a learning period).
