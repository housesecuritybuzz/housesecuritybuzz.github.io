And while this is a pretty standard feature in indoor cameras, two-way audio is fairly rare in outdoor security cameras.</p>

In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only an incorrect sense of security since it prevents only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
