Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limits, we frequently discovered action missing, thanks to irregular and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
