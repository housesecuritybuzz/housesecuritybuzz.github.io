<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
<p>It would be simple to roll your eyes at this last point, but it suggests you can ask your home security camera for the weather forecast - or whatever Google search takes your fancy - and a speaker within the unit will respond. It also indicates that if you really saw a burglar riffle through your home, you could quickly tape-record a message to him or her through your smartphone, and the Nest would play it aloud. Which, you envision, would be enough to send even the most dedicated career criminal scuttling empty-handed down the road. </p>
