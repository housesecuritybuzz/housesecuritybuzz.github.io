<p>The Blue by ADT Outdoor Camera is a work in development. We have actually seen enhancements during our short time with the battery-operated camera, but we just can't recommend a $200 camera that does not use the capability to zoom video and won't have the ability to withstand outdoor temperatures listed below 14 degrees Fahrenheit. Keep an eye on your home, office, or shop with our video surveillance systems. Use a desktop, laptop computer, tablet or choose smart device to access live and recorded video coverage from a secure IP connection.</p>
<p>IP security cameras catch analog images and transform them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing abilities like compression and motion detection. The caught digital video stream is then transmitted over a local location network (LAN) using Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which catches each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and review. The system can be set up to communicate through network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
