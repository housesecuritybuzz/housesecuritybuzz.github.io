<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
