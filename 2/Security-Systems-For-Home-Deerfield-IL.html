<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it provides protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software application to detect it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only an incorrect sense of security considering that it prevents only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
