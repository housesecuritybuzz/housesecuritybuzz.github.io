<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. In a network injection attack, a hacker can make use of access points that are exposed to non-filtered network traffic, specifically relaying network traffic such as Spanning Tree" (802.1 D), OSPF, RIP, and HSRP The hacker injects bogus networking re-configuration commands that affect routers, switches, and intelligent hubs. A whole network can be lowered in this way and need rebooting or perhaps reprogramming of all smart networking gadgets.</p>
<p>A system that needs a contract may be a clever option for those who are cash-strapped or do not wish to pay for the equipment up-front. Why?

We have actually seen 1-year, all the way as much as 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you don't want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term agreement (and who does?). Our choice: No contract.</p>
