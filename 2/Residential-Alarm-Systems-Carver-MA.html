<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is an enjoyment to use as well (a lot much better than the apps you get with some budget plan security cameras), though if you wish to enter into its cleverest customisations, there is a little a learning curve. For all the more basic smarts, it's great, though.

When you're feeling old-fashioned, you can control Vivint security with a keychain remote, a mobile app or the main control panel.</p>
