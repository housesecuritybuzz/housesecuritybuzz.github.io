<p>1-3 Incorrect alarms: $25. It's a superior package but it's expensive, and to get the most out of it (like cloud storage archives or motion zones) you really need to sign up for a subscription too. If you're on a spending plan, you can simply about get by with the live motion informs and livestreaming (no subscription required).

<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear video in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching video footage in the dark is a priority.</p>
<p>While many companies offer you the choice to include both indoor and outdoor cameras to your security bundle, SimpliSafe's selection is restricted to one indoor surveillance camera. The camera consists of functions like free streamable HD video and audio, 30-day storage, and night vision, but it does not take snapshots of activity and can't pan or move-- basic functions found on the majority of surveillance cameras. </p>
