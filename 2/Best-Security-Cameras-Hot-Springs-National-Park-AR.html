<p>A wired security system was the very first kind of security system that was invented for homeowners. It should be set up by an expert alarm installation group and, once set up, is hard to move from one place to another. Wired systems are more typical for large residential or commercial properties and are typically more expensive than a wireless home security system. They can consist of outdoor cameras and an indoor camera similar to the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the group will need to rework the existing wires in your house. The group will be able to recycle the existing wiring if you have actually already set up a wired system in the past and you are upgrading to a new system. However, if this is your first system, the alarm installation procedure can take upwards of three hours.</p>
<p>We tried each of the cameras in several places around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was connected to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we tested each camera using an iOS device (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) in addition to an Android smartphone (using a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint uses a wide range of equipment and home automation products at an affordable rate, the one location where the company especially stands out remains in DIY installation. </p>
