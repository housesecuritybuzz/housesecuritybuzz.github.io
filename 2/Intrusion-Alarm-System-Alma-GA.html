<p>The House Smart Security Set, our previous runner-up, is still a strong choice for some people. Home has upgraded that version with 4G cellular backup and an onboard Z-Wave 500 Series chip, which offers a much better variety for sensing units. Both the initial House system and the Home Iota are compatible with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, however the Iota is the only model we tested that also works with HomeKit. We've encountered a couple of technical problems while long-term testing the Home Iota, therefore will continue to evaluate and update accordingly. We no longer suggest it.</p>
<p>This likewise depends upon the provider, however you can prepare for signing a contract with suppliers who need professional installation of their systems. The average length of a home security agreement is 36 months or 3 years. On the higher end, some agreements could span up to 60 months or 5 years. If you want to avoid needing to sign a contract, we would recommend thinking about a Do It Yourself home security system instead.</p>
<p>When buying a system online, be aware that the majority of the time professional alarm companies will not install customer bought products! Why?

We've seen it highlight cars and trucks, moths, and mice.</p>

<p>Some security cameras allow you to set up customized activity zones, suggesting that you pick the locations that are most considerable for capturing movement.
