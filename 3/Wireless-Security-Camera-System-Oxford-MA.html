When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those people and will send mobile phone signals with that info when they show up at your home.

We likewise discovered the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a broader range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
