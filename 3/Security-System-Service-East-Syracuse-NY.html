The implicit justification for the current push to increase video surveillance is the risk of terrorist attacks. But suicide assailants are plainly not prevented by camera - and may even be drawn in to the tv protection cameras can ensure - and the expenditure of a comprehensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up approximately 20 percent of that country's criminal justice spending plan - far surpasses the restricted advantages that the system may provide in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the reality (see truth sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
