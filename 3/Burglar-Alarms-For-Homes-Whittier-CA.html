<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive plan, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and features are almost identical to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's plans are somewhat more pricey for the exact same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation fees are burdensome, and its prices is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyway.</p>
