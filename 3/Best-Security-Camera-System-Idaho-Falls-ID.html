<p>All About Security provides professional, reputable alarm monitoring services for homes and companies throughout the greater Indianapolis area. The more advanced cameras in the market enable two-way audio between people on either side of the video surveillance system. When implemented properly, two-way audio is a feature with tons of applications - security and non-security. This consists of background music services, providing help-desk assistance from another location, improving loss avoidance, monitoring high-traffic areas, hostility detection, and targeted retail messaging.</p>
<p>A system that needs an agreement might be a smart option for those who are cash-strapped or do not want to spend for the equipment up-front. Why?

We have actually seen 1-year, all the way as much as 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we suggest contract-free systems if you don't wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term arrangement (and who does?). Our pick: No agreement.</p>
