<p>Consider it by doing this, if a decent still-camera costs a minimum of 2 hundred and fifty dollars (US $), how can a more sophisticated camera be sold for the low price of forty dollars? It just does not accumulate. To offer such low prices, producers should cut corners, and the end outcome is compromised efficiency. What good is a surveillance camera that just works ideally in best conditions like brilliant sunshine? Consumer-grade cameras can work well in specific situations such as nanny cameras or checking in on an animal, though when looking to gather proof of a crime they often lose.</p>

<p>The San Diego Cops Department wanted to get to video footage from public and private cameras in genuine time as part of the Operation Secure San Diego" surveillance program As of 2014, the program was riddled with software compatibility issues, and officers had difficulty viewing footage in genuine time because the department's police car did not have a 4G connection.

<p>The SimpliSafe equipment is now in its third version, with a simpler and more trendy design for both app and gadgets.
