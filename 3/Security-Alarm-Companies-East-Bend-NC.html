<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, a lot of burglar alarms work the precise same method. They use open and closed circuits to move an electric current.

If the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits, which implies. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be moved. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, opening the door permits the electrical current to flow throughout the system, which implies when the doors are shut the alarm system will set off.</p>
