<p>Maybe this is no better showed than by means of Surveillance Camera Commissioner, Tony Porter's comments, at IFSEC International in 2019 Tony highlighted just how much had changed because he took on the function in 2014, with the development of facial recognition, drones, body-worn cameras, analytics, GDPR and far more. Modern systems now have incredible capabilities", though these have produced easy to understand misgivings about the threat for personal privacy and prospective abuse such capabilities develop.

<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it counts on a wireless signal, meaning that storms and strong winds have the power to disrupt the system and could even set off incorrect alarms. Incorrect alarms are known to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could lead to fines from the provider or the cops if they happen frequently enough. Another prospective disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment need to be replaced or charged frequently in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is generally balanced out by the fact that there are no installation costs.</p>

However, you may choose to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is generally provided for cameras that are monitoring indoor, residential areas). Cameras that are not monitored by the central station can not be accessed our operators for any factor, even if requested by the consumer. </p>
