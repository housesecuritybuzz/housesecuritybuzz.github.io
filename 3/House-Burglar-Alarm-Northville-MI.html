<p>One crucial exception: ADT has a landline monitoring strategy that's $36.99 monthly, which might be a budget-friendly alternative for consumers in backwoods. We advise cellular systems because they're far more secure than landline systems, but there are some places where cellular monitoring isn't readily available. A landline system is still much better than no security at all if you live someplace without access to cellular monitoring.</p>
<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing footage in the dark is a concern.</p>
