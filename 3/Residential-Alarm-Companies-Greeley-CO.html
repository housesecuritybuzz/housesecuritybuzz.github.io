<p>After evaluating dozens of wired and wireless alternatives, the best home security camera for many people is the Arlo Pro 2. It tapes high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is completely wireless, and can be established both inside and out, as it's weather condition resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have a contract, and its equipment pricing is extremely sensible, so it's not an overall splurge. However you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>
