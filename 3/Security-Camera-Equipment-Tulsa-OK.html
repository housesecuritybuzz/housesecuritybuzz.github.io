<p>Any smart security system worth its salt uses parts that work together in a seamless environment and can be controlled using customized rules. For instance, you can produce rules to have the lights switch on when motion is discovered, have your doors unlock when a smoke detector goes off, and have a camera begin tape-recording when a sensing unit is set off. Some systems keep taped video in your area on an SD card or a strong state drive, while others offer cloud storage. Locally kept video is a good choice for do-it-yourselfers on a budget plan, but you need to be careful not to overwrite video you may require later on. Cloud storage makes it easy to shop and access taped video, however it can cost hundreds of dollars annually depending on your membership. Some systems provide both cloud storage and local storage, and some offer a devoted storage drive that gives you DVR abilities with time-lapse recording, which makes it easy to discover a video event that occurred at a particular moment.</p>
