<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between people and basic motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
