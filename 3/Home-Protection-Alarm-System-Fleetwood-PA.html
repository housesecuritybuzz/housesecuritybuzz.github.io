<p>Some wireless home security systems use a video recording storage alternative and others do not. For the ones that do not, you are able to see a live video feed of your home at any time you access your system; however, nothing is tape-recorded.

This option is usually cost-free. A cloud storage alternative saves your video in the cloud. Nevertheless, this is normally a paid service and the variety of hours it will save will depend upon how much cloud storage you are willing to pay for.</p>

Couple of companies have a larger series of equipment or bigger security network readily available. </p>
