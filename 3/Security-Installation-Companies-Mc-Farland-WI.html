We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
<p>The Hive View delivers excellent 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation triggered too quickly, even when on the most affordable level of sensitivity setting. Since this camera has no native geofencing functions, you have to by hand stop alerts (and recording, because it does that even when alerts are off). We likewise experienced above-average connectivity problems, with two Hive test units detaching 8 times over 2 months.</p>
