<h3>Home Camera System in Nekoosa WI</h3>
<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is an enjoyment to use too (a lot better than the apps you get with some budget security cameras), though if you want to enter into its cleverest customisations, there is a little a learning curve.

Likewise, it will arm itself immediately when everyone has left.</p>
