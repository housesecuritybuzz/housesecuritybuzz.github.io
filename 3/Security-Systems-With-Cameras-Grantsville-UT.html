<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that distinguish between people and general motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
