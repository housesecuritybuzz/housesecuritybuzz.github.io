<p>According to a report, homes that do not have a security system are 3 times most likely to be robbed. Brinks owns and operates its own US-based monitoring center. Its monitoring service consists of a benefit called ASAPer, which at the same time messages a group of pre-set contacts to determine whether alarm activity is a true emergency situation or incorrect alarm. A lot of monitoring center call household members one at a time, which can slow response times.</p>
<p>The other major choice when selecting a home security camera is whether you require an indoor or outdoor  camera. Outdoor cameras will frequently be constructed to be more durable and able to endure rain, frost, or damp.

<p>Buy a rechargeable battery base too and you can put the weatherproof camera throughout Wi-Fi range (it lasts approximately three months in between charges).
