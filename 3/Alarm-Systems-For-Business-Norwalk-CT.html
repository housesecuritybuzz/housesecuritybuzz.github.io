<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it supplies protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software application to detect it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only a false sense of security because it avoids just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>

When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name.
