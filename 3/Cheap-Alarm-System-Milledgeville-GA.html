<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your house so we could point them at the same spot and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting components, which I had actually set up on the porch by a licensed electrician (who happens to be my other half). All of the cameras were connected to the exact same 2.4 GHz network by means of a Wi-Fi router inside your home (roughly 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>Our experience with expert installation was mixed. Our tester stated the specialist provided strong customer care: He dropped a few unnecessary window sensors from my costs after deciding that the motion detector sufficed for the entire front half of my home."
