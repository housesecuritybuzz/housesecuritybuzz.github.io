<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it supplies protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software to discover it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect complacency since it prevents only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
