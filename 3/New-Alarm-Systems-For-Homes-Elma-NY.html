<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by an expert home security company. When the system spots a break-in, fire, or other emergency situation, it alerts the security group and, sometimes, emergency responders.

<p>Security cameras that are part of a monitored security system typically have the exact same functions and choices as stand-alone cameras. Keep cameras off your home wifi network. Alarm monitoring is not only an economical method to secure your home or business from burglary, medical and fire emergencies, however it may pay for itself!
