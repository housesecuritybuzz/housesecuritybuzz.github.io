<p>The Blink XT2 is small, operates on 2 AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of complimentary cloud storage, and it catches a better image and longer clips than its predecessors.

Likewise, if the camera is in the middle of recording, don't anticipate to get a live peek or make any settings modifications-- it can't multitask.</p>
