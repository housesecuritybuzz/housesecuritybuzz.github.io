<p>The Frontpoint Security system, along with its Interactive plan, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and features are nearly identical to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's plans are somewhat more pricey for the exact same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation fees are difficult, and its prices is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer suggest anyhow.</p>
