<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were remarkable in our screening-- throughout the day and in the evening-- with a wide, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We need to note that the camera would periodically downgrade the picture quality based upon readily available bandwidth, which might vary throughout the day.

Our tester went with the Interactive strategy however ended up dissatisfied with its absence of live video surveillance.
