<p>However, in any scenario where standard-definition video cameras are utilized, the quality is going to be poor since the maximum pixel resolution of the image chips in the majority of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is measured in TV lines however the outcomes are the exact same); they generally capture vertical and horizontal fields of lines and blend them together to make a single frame; the optimum frame rate is typically 30 frames per second.</p>
<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
<p>When I ultimately entered the camera controls, I was reasonably amazed. The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a solid night-vision mode, and all the app controls are fairly self-explanatory. You've got two-way audio, you can play tunes just to let the person being seen understand they're being viewed, and you can select to tape video or photos and save them to your clever device on a whim. </p>
