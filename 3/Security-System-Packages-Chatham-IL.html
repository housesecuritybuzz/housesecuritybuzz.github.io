<p>The occurrence of video surveillance systems as a service (VSSaaS) service has risen in recent years. Although local storage is effective in its own respect, it has several caveats.

<h3>Home Security Provider in Illinois</h3>
<p>Where does the video feed go? Does the camera shop to an SD card, which you'll require to manually get rid of to transfer the data?

<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do nowadays - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the big amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and typically over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reputable, however not compatible with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, removing the need for additional electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may need less wiring in the walls however will still need cables to power the security camera separately, usually through 110VAC power. </p>
