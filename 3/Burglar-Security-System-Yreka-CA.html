<p>For these separate systems to assemble or to integrate them together into a single user interface, a detailed understanding of all the required systems is needed. If there are no as-built files providing performance and setup information to make this integration work, there are only 2 options. The first option, which might be the most intricate, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial service provider is unwilling or not available to provide those information) and document the topology and how they can be included into the new DVS system. The other approach is to rip and change, performing a total upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to converge them all.</p>
