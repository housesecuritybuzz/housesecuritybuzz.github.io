<p>Recently, Ring rejected reports that it had actually suffered a data breach, however we agree with its suggestion that users should reset passwords and enable two-factor authentication as a preventive procedure. All smart-home devices are vulnerable to such incidents. However, after this latest entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have actually chosen to pull our suggestion of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first check out the What about Ring? section from our clever video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it comes to video products, we do not think that these issues alter the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay confident in our current recommendation.</p>
