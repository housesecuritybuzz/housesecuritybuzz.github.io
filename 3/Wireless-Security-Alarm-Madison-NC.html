<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>

Having the ability to distinguish between an individual and a cars and truck, for example, enables you to reduce unneeded notifies. And Activity Zones are a nice perk, especially if you're aiming to monitor a particular corner of the lawn, a doorway, or perhaps trash bin. </p>
