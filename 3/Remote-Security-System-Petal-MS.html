<p>The best in clever home security systems. Life can get chaotic in some cases, and it can be challenging monitoring whatever around you. Fortunately, a surveillance camera can lend an additional pair of eyes and function as lookout for you and your household. Surveillance cameras are cameras used to record the activity of the environment in which they are placed, normally for use in combination with security measures.

<p>After evaluating lots of wired and wireless alternatives, the best home security camera for many people is the Arlo Pro 2. It tapes high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is totally wireless, and can be set up both inside and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint doesn't have an agreement, and its equipment prices is super reasonable, so it's not a total splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the similarity Vivint or Brinks.</p>
