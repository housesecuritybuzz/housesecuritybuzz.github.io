<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to sign in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We first observed Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it quickly ended up being a personnel (and friends and family) favorite. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker.
