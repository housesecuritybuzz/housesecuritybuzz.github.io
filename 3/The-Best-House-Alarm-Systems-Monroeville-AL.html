<p>Did You Know: Back in the 1980s, home security systems used to be so expensive that they were out of reach for a lot of Americans.

Nevertheless, alarm pros say having an unmonitored system is still much better than having no security system at all.</p>
<p>Compression: Compression is used to remove unneeded information from the footage sent to your video recorder, thus saving space. Two of the more typical compression methods used for high-definition video are MJPEG and H. 264.
