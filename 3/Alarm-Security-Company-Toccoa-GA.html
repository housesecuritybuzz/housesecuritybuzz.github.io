<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal given that the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when customers realize that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
