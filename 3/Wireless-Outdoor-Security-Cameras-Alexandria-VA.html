<h3>Home Security Alarm System in Virginia</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually discovered that battery life never matches the producer's statistics given that this comes from tests in a controlled environment without constant video recording, which is the greatest offender for short battery life by far. We concur with you about Blink's exceptional battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, but its recording capacity is a bit minimal to advise as a top choice.</p>
<p>No matter the resolution, try to pick a camera with a reasonably wide field of vision (seeing angle) and make sure it can catch clear night vision video. A lot of cameras utilize IR (infrared) LEDs to deliver black-and-white night video, but there are a few out there that use white light to provide full-color night video. Look for a camera with a night vision range of at least 30 feet.</p>
