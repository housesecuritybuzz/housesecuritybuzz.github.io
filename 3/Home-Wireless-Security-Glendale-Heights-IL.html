<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
