<h3>CCTV Surveillance Camera in Harrison Township MI</h3>
<p>One of the very best aspects of this alarm is that it has an extremely innovative motion sensor.

<p>We don't suggest the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complex than it should be. Recordings, signals, and combination all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing out on, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
