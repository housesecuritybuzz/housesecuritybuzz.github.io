<p>There is a new trend in surveillance video search technology that is rapidly altering the security market, and it is called Deep Knowing". What is Deep Knowing and why is it so essential?  For beginners, Deep Learning enables somebody to discover what they are searching for without needing to explore hours of useless video footage.  Picture a web page that works a lot like a Google search, where you can explain the components you are looking for in the tape-recorded video footage.  For instance, if we need to see all video from today that has a police car in it, we just type police" into the search window and in seconds every secret frame of video with a patrol car appears.  With deep knowing video search, you now have an effective service for gathering and catching criminals evidence.</p>
<p>In addition to the system itself, security alarms are often coupled with a monitoring service. In the event of an alarm, the premises control system contacts a main monitoring station.

Such signals may be transferred through devoted alarm circuits, telephone lines, or the internet.</p>

These companies created their equipment this way to make consumers stick with them longer, because changing monitoring companies implies numerous dollars down the drain and a substantial headache for customers. Alexa assistance is consisted of, as you would expect from an Amazon-owned brand name, and the camera competently handles all the normal functions when it concerns motion detection and two-way audio. Night vision is included too, for when the lights go out. </p>
