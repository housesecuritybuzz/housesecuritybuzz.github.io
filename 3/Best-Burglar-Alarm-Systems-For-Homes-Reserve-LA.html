While IP cameras are generally more costly than their analog counterparts, the total cost of a full IP system tends to be somewhat lower than that of a comparable analog system.

Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have a contract, and its equipment pricing is very reasonable, so it's not a total splurge. However you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the similarity Vivint or Brinks.</p>
