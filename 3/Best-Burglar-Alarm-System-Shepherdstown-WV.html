While the company has an A rating with the Bbb (BBB), its general consumer score is just over 1 star out of 5. ADT uses an online understanding base or you can call anytime for help if you require help with your system.

<p>The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, but it pumps images approximately 4K resolution and has a fantastic daytime image.

<p>No matter the resolution, try to pick a camera with a fairly broad field of vision (seeing angle) and make sure it can record clear night vision video. Most cameras utilize IR (infrared) LEDs to provide black-and-white night video, but there are a couple of out there that use white light to provide full-color night video.
