<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a quick explanation of how thermal cameras work: All objects produce infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature level. The infrared energy given off by a things is known as its heat signature. In general, the hotter an item is, the more radiation it releases. A thermal camera includes a heat sensor that is capable of finding tiny differences in temperature. The device gathers the infrared radiation from things in the scene and produces an electronic image based on information about the temperature level distinctions. Since objects are rarely exactly the very same temperature as other items around them, a thermal camera can identify them, and they will appear as unique in a thermal image.</p>
