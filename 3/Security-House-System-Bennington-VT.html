You don't need to buy a multi-million dollar surveillance system to keep an eye on your property and ownerships.

The first wireless function to think about is the security system and its components, and how they all connect. In the past, every monitoring component was hard-wired back to a panel box. This indicated every door and window needed its own wire and path of holes through your house.</p>
