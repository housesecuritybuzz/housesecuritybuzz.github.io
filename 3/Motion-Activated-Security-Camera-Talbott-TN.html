<p>Expenses for systems vary. Larger systems that offer full-house protection with professional monitoring are the most costly alternatives. Smaller sized, self-monitored systems are the most budget-friendly choice. Keep in mind that cameras with two-way audio typically work like walkie talkies.

<p>Another advantage to monitored systems is if you acquire a monitored security strategy, the very same company that monitors the system will install it for you. Having an expert set up the system might provide you more self-confidence than if you did the work yourself if you're not mechanically likely. Wireless cameras can't have it all-- view things inside by day, and keep an eye on what's going on outside after dark. It seldom works.</p>
