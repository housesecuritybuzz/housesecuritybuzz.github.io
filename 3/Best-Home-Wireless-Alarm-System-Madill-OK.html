<p>Another consideration with wireless home security systems is the restricted variety of sensing units. A lot of radio frequencies are weak outside a variety of 500 feet. This indicates that you have to structure your wireless system with this in mind, particularly if your home is larger than 4,500 square feet.

After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.
