<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Readily Available. Standard parts in a lot of home security packages consist of a master control panel, the control keypad, sensor pads for windows and doors and a motion sensing unit gadget. Some systems are linked to an offsite alarm monitoring service, while others have at home alarms.

<p>A system that requires a contract may be a wise choice for those who are cash-strapped or do not wish to spend for the equipment up-front. Why? Due to the fact that contract-based security systems generally do not come with upfront charges. Rather, the costs are spread out over the length of the agreement. We've seen 1-year, all the way up to 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you do not wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term agreement (and who does?). Our choice: No contract.</p>
