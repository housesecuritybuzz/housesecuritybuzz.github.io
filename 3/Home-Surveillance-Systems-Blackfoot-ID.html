<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely regular because the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, when consumers understand that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
