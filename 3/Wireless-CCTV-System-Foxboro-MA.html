<p>One of the obstacles clever alarm systems pose to the consumer is the risk of being hacked. Incorrect home network setups, defects in the devices or password compromise could allow a hacker to break into the system and identify if anybody is home, or even take control. Though keeping the vast amount of information can be a concern, it's not unusual for IP CCTV systems to have software that governs the length of time the video is kept, and at what quality. After a time, video can be compressed to conserve storage space, for instance.</p>
<p>So what takes place if something activates your alarm but you're in a conference with a supplier and you do not get the alert?

The noise may terrify off would-be trespassers-- if you're fortunate if your system equipment includes an audible alarm. However the police will not come up until you personally call them. </p>
