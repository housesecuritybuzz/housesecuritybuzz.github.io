Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly cost (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we frequently found action missing out on, thanks to irregular and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>

Our tester selected the Interactive plan but ended up discontented with its lack of live video surveillance.

It turned out to be an incorrect alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>
