<p>Recently, Ring rejected reports that it had actually suffered an information breach, but we concur with its recommendation that users should reset passwords and enable two-factor authentication as a precautionary procedure. All smart-home gadgets are susceptible to such incidents. However, after this latest entry in a year-long series of controversial media reports, we have chosen to pull our suggestion of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? section from our wise video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it comes to video items, we do not believe that these concerns change the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain confident in our existing recommendation.</p>
