<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to sign in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We initially saw Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E But once we attempted it out, it rapidly ended up being a staff (and friends and family) favorite. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send out informs, you can't control it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
