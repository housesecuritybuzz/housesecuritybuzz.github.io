<p>The Hive View provides terrific 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation activated too quickly, even when on the lowest level of sensitivity setting.

We also experienced above-average connection issues, with two Hive test systems detaching 8 times over 2 months.</p>
<p>iSmart also provides phone call alerts natively. Of course, you can setup telephone call signals for abode and Arlo via IFTTT, but Ring and Nest are both waiting on IFTTT and even still, utilizing IFTTT isn't as dependable as a native feature.

<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to check in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We first discovered Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it rapidly became a personnel (and family and friends) favorite. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker.
