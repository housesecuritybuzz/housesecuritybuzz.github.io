<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we might point them at the very same area and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting components, which I had set up on the deck by a licensed electrical expert (who takes place to be my partner). All of the cameras were linked to the exact same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router inside (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to your house was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>It would be easy to roll your eyes at this last point, but it suggests you can ask your home security camera for the weather report - or whatever Google search takes your fancy - and a speaker within the unit will reply. It also suggests that if you actually saw a burglar riffle through your home, you could quickly tape a message to him or her through your smart device, and the Nest would play it aloud. Which, you think of, would suffice to send out even the most committed profession criminal scampering empty-handed down the roadway. </p>
