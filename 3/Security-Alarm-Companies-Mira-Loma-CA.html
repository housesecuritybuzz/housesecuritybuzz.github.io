<p>A system that requires a contract may be a wise choice for those who are cash-strapped or don't wish to spend for the equipment up-front. Why?

We've seen 1-year, all the way as much as 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we suggest contract-free systems if you do not wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting agreement (and who does?). Our choice: No agreement.</p>
