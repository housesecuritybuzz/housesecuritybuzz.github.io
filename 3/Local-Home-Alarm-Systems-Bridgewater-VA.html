We first noticed Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it rapidly became a personnel (and friends and family) favorite.

It can't send out notifies, you can't control it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
