<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is premium, if not especially groundbreaking, so we're truly suggesting the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan alternative. Sure, you get a lower rate if you opt for a three-year agreement, but because Nest requires you to pay 100% of your remaining contract if you cancel, it's a huge commitment. So choose what will be the better deal for you. Go with the contract and gain those cost savings if you know you'll stay put for at least 3 years. But if you might upgrade to a new office with different security needs, contract-free is your best option.</p>

It costs a lot, its prices isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to mention that the customer care experience varies widely depending upon the dealer you choose. </p>
