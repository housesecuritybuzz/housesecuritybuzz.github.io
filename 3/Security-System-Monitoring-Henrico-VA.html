A lot of home security companies will charge you around 75% of the remaining term of your contract if you cancel early-- and some require 100%.</p>
<p>Consumers can select amongst three package tiers, each of which uses a various set-up of features, from basic monitoring with the Protection package to live video streaming with the Ultimate plan.
