On the easier side, with SimpliSafe, you trade the bells and whistles of wise home equipment for versatility and low prices.

Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we typically discovered action missing out on, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>

Although the rate may drive some away, the pros far surpass the cons, particularly with the capability to tape-record 2K HDR video, along with an incorporated spotlight and "color" night vision.
