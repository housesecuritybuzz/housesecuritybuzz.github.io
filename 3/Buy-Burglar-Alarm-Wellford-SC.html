<p>For these separate systems to assemble or to incorporate them together into a single user interface, a detailed knowledge of all the needed systems is needed. If there are no as-built documents offering functionality and configuration details to make this combination work, there are just 2 choices. The first option, which may be the most complex, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original option provider is not available or reluctant to supply those details) and record the topology and how they can be incorporated into the new DVS system.
