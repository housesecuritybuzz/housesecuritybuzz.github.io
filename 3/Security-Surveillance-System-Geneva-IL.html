<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally normal considering that the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when clients recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's usually far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
