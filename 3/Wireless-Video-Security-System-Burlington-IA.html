<p>B. This chapter governs alarm system systems meant to summon cops department workers, needs registration, assessment of charges for excessive false burglar alarms, supplies procedures for repeat wrongdoers, and provides an efficient date. Another big feature is night vision. You might likewise consider a camera with an integrated motion-activated light-- all the much better to scare you with, my dear!
