So why isn't it a pick? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smart device alerts and live views were painfully sluggish, and the range is poor. Likewise, if the camera remains in the middle of recording, do not anticipate to get a live peek or make any settings modifications-- it can't multitask.</p>
