<p>Absolutely nothing is more important than safeguarding what you treasure most ... your household and home. You do not need to purchase a multi-million dollar surveillance system to watch on your residential or commercial property and possessions. In the event that your alarm is triggered, your home security system sends a wireless alert to the monitoring company where security professionals are waiting to respond by instantly connecting with you and if need be, the regional medical, fire or cops authorities.</p>
<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids talking to someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, false alarms are fairly typical. If a property owner forgets their keys and returns within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is activated by a community feline, it can set off the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the house owner will be contacted by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it quickly. False alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a property owner will not receive calls from a monitoring company. Instead, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the necessary action.</p>
