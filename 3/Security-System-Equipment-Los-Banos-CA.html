<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can determine people the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name.

We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to distinguish expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also supply a broader series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
