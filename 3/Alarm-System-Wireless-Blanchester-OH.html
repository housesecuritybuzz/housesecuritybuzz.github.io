I called their customer support group and they acknowledged that the sales people do not need to discuss it, it's on you to check out the small print. I'm paying the swelling sum, due to the fact that obviously they vehicle renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send in a composed not by mail.
