Locally kept video is a good option for do-it-yourselfers on a budget, but you need to take care not to overwrite video you might need later on.

Some systems provide both cloud storage and local storage, and some provide a dedicated storage drive that provides you DVR capabilities with time-lapse recording, which makes it simple to find a video event that took place at a specific moment.</p>
