<p>We have all heard that old saying, you get what you pay for". According to a report published by the Urban Institute, cops departments across the country respond to millions of false alarms from resident and business security systems every year. This costs cities and towns countless dollars in squandered police resources. The Vivint Smart Home security system is reputable and simple to use, however costly and eccentric unless you desire the convenience of a pro install and upkeep.</p>
<p>A system that needs an agreement might be a smart option for those who are cash-strapped or do not want to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Because contract-based security systems generally do not included upfront fees. Rather, the expenses are spread out over the length of the agreement. We have actually seen 1-year, all the method approximately 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we suggest contract-free systems if you don't wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term agreement (and who does?). Our choice: No agreement.</p>
