<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it offers protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software to discover it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only a false sense of security since it avoids just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>

<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most highly innovative outdoor camera we have actually evaluated.
