<p>One vital exception: ADT has a landline monitoring strategy that's $36.99 per month, which could be an affordable alternative for clients in rural areas. We recommend cellular systems due to the fact that they're much more secure than landline systems, however there are some locations where cellular monitoring isn't readily available.

It has a close-up tracking feature, which immediately focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision.
