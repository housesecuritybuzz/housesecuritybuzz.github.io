<h2>Complete CCTV Security System Rio Linda</h2>
<p>Analog security cameras send lower resolution video over coax cable and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can deal with such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom.

<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it offers protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software to discover it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only an incorrect sense of security since it prevents only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
