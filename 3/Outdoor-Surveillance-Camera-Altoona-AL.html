<p>Because it's more complex than it ought to be, we do not suggest the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, notifies, and integration all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we typically found action missing, thanks to lengthy and irregular gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>

<p>The Canary Flex includes a smart variation that sends out alerts directly to your phone if you're looking for motion detection. This camera offers a wide variety of features including a 360-degree rotating base. Last time I reviewed a Swann camera I described it as decidedly middle of the roadway. Not fantastic, not awful, but with an actually easy setup process (and trust me, that truly is a killer feature when it pertains to wise cameras.) This newer version is much the same, to be frank.</p>
<p>When I ultimately got into the camera controls, I was reasonably satisfied. The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a strong night-vision mode, and all the app controls are fairly obvious.
