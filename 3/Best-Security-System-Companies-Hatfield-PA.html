<p>Cameras frequently transmit footage over the Internet, permitting operators to monitor security camera feeds remotely. In many cases, surveillance systems are spent for and run by the cities themselves. But in other cases, businesses and homeowners share surveillance camera footage with police officers. As with any security system, the more equipment you add, the costlier it gets. When you add smart cameras to any Blue system, and that rate jumps a lot. We like that you can choose from indoor, outdoor, and doorbell cameras, but every clever camera Blue deals is $200.</p>

<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously impressive piece of technology. For beginners, it looks beautiful: the all-white style and black camera face are seriously spacey (if strangely similar to the AI in 2001: A Space Odyssey). When you envision a home security camera, it's far from the horrid metal CCTV box that you might call to mind. The first wireless function to think about is the security system and its components, and how they all link. In the past, every monitoring element was hard-wired back to a panel box.
