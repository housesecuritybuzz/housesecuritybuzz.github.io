Salt Lake City needs verification from a personal security personnel. A number of cities also need a license to even operate a home and own security system. Guidelines such as these are created to limit the time and resources that authorities and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Numerous municipalities will fine you for a lot of false alarms.</p>

<p>Remember that Nest cameras aren't professionally monitored-- that part's on you. (The remainder of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) However given that a lot of retail theft would not trip an alarm anyhow (a worker slipping some extra money while offering a client change, for instance), we believe it's more crucial to have premium images so you have the evidence you need. And that's what Nest offers you.</p>
<p>During our testing, this compact camera tape-recorded sharp, 1080p HD images day and night, and its digital zoom worked for taking a more detailed look.

For less than $400, you get two door and window sensors, one motion detector, and a video doorbell with two-way talk.</p>
