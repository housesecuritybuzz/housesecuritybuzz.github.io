<p>The downside to a wireless system is that it counts on a wireless signal, meaning that storms and strong winds have the power to interfere with the system and could even trigger incorrect alarms. Incorrect alarms are understood to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could result in fines from the provider or the cops if they happen frequently enough. Another prospective disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool need to be replaced or charged routinely in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can likewise be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is generally offset by the fact that there are no installation costs.</p>
