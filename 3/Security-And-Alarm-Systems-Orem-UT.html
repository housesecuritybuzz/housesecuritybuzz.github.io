<p>The Frontpoint Security system, in addition to its Interactive strategy, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and functions are nearly identical to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's plans are slightly more pricey for the exact same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation charges are onerous, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer suggest anyway.</p>
<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not especially cutting-edge, so we're actually advising the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free strategy option. Sure, you get a lower price if you opt for a three-year agreement, however given that Nest requires you to pay 100% of your staying agreement if you cancel, it's a huge commitment. So choose what will be the much better offer for you. Go with the agreement and reap those savings if you know you'll stay put for at least three years. However if you may update to a new office with various security requirements, contract-free is your best choice.</p>
