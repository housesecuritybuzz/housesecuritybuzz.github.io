<p>Due to the fact that it's more complex than it must be, we do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, notifies, and combination all require separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 per year) to save 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we frequently discovered action missing, thanks to lengthy and irregular gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
