We need to keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the photo quality based upon available bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day. Nest consists of the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that may defeat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>

This creates a one in three possibility of capturing a particular event on video (either live or tape-recorded).
