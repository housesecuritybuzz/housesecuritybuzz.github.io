<p>Just recently, Ring denied reports that it had suffered an information breach, but we concur with its recommendation that users should reset passwords and make it possible for two-factor authentication as a preventive step. All smart-home gadgets are vulnerable to such occurrences.

If you prepare to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? area from our wise video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it comes to video items, we don't think that these concerns modify the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay confident in our existing recommendation.</p>
