<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely typical given that the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level.
