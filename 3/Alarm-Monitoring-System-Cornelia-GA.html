<p>Recently, Ring rejected reports that it had suffered a data breach, but we agree with its recommendation that users need to reset passwords and make it possible for two-factor authentication as a preventive step. All smart-home gadgets are susceptible to such events. However, after this most current entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have chosen to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? section from our wise video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it concerns video products, we do not think that these concerns alter the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay confident in our present suggestion.</p>
