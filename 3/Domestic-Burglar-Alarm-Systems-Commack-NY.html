<p>A self-monitored home security system relies on the homeowner to view their home and contact police in case of an emergency. A self-monitored system doesn't suggest a house owner has to sacrifice any functions. Homeowners can personalize the system to their requirements and can decide to have the unit expertly installed or do it themselves.

<p>The Hive View provides excellent 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation set off too easily, even when on the most affordable level of sensitivity setting.

<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it provides protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software application to find it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect complacency since it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
