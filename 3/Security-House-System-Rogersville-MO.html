<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between people and basic motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
