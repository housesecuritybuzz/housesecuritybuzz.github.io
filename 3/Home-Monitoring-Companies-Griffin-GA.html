<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it provides protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only a false complacency because it prevents only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
