As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely typical since the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
