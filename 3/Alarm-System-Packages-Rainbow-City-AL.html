We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that compare individuals and basic motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
