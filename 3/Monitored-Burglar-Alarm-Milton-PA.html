<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that compare people and basic motion. We think that's pricey.</p>
