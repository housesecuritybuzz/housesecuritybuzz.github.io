<p>The 2nd crucial thing to state is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a remarkably shrill built-in alarm, so it operates as a home alarm along with a security camera. That separates it from the products I have actually currently written, and helps in part to discuss its cost. This Canary Flex is a home security camera that packs a big punch in a little bundle.
