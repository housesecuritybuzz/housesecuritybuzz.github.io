<p>We looked for Do It Yourself systems that used expert monitoring, both with and without an agreement. Although some companies supply free or heavily affordable hardware in exchange for a service dedication that can last anywhere from one to five years, we found no-contract systems to be the most flexible. Some individuals might want to sign up for service only for when they or their partner is out of town, for instance. No-contract systems also cost less in the long run and permit you to be in overall control of the equipment you use, as well as how and when you pay and use for monitoring services.</p>
<p>The Hive View provides terrific 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation triggered too quickly, even when on the lowest level of sensitivity setting. Because this camera has no native geofencing functions, you have to by hand stop alerts (and recording, given that it does that even when notifications are off). We also experienced above-average connection issues, with two Hive test systems disconnecting eight times over 2 months.</p>

It ended up being an incorrect alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>

<p>Dome IP camera, as the name suggests, is a type of CCTV camera with a dome cover. However beyond that I just had issues. The switch from daytime to night vision took about five minutes (though it worked great changing from night to day.) The motion detector is bad. I was carrying out the macarena in front of the camera for about 2 minutes before it even noticed I existed. </p>
