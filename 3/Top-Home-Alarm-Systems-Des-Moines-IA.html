<p>Nothing is more crucial than protecting what you treasure most ... your family and home. The implicit justification for the recent push to increase video surveillance is the threat of terrorist attacks. However suicide assaulters are clearly not deterred by video cameras - and might even be attracted to the tv coverage cameras can ensure - and the expense of a comprehensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up roughly 20 percent of that country's criminal justice budget plan - far exceeds the limited advantages that the system may offer in investigating attacks or tried attacks after the truth (see reality sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>

We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) likewise provide a broader variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
