Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to disregard items that apply percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is set up to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
