<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it depends on a wireless signal, indicating that storms and strong winds have the power to interrupt the system and might even activate false alarms. Incorrect alarms are understood to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might result in fines from the provider or the police if they happen regularly enough. Another possible downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment need to be replaced or charged frequently in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is normally offset by the fact that there are no installation expenses.</p>
