<p>Spend some time to read online reviews and not just those on the company's website. Take a look at the Bbb site specifically.

<p>I described that all we would need to do is use any among the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which likewise included two-way audio, and that camera would end up being the user interface into the VMS system. When a patient pushes the emergency situation button, it sends out dual signals: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Moreover, if the central patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the threat and, if required, might just press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular flooring.</p>
