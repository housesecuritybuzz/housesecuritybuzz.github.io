<p>But monitored systems also tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey monthly charge for a set quantity of time, usually one to five years. No-contract systems, which enable you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than dedicating to a long-term plan, are becoming more common. These systems in some cases cost more up front for the hardware than pro systems that provide a discount in exchange for that prolonged service contract. Spending for the equipment up front supplies you with a great deal of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you utilize the service. And you can begin and stop the monitoring service as sometimes as you desire.</p>
