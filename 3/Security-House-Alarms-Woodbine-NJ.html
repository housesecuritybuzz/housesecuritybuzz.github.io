<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can determine people the camera is finding using face recognition.

We also found the feature to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a nearby TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also supply a larger variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
