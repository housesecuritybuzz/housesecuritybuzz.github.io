Which would then set off the burglar alarm if someone were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be transferred. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, unlocking permits the electrical existing to flow throughout the system, which implies when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>
