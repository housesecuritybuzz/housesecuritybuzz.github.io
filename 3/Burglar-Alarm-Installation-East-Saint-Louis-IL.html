The innovation gradually evolved into the extremely advanced yet cost effective systems available today. The first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to record video and enjoy it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to improve the result of security systems.</p>
