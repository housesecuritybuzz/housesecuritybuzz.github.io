<p>There is a new trend in surveillance video search technology that is rapidly altering the security industry, and it is called Deep Learning". What is Deep Learning and why is it so important?  For starters, Deep Learning allows somebody to discover what they are looking for without needing to search through hours of useless video footage.  Think of a website that works a lot like a Google search, where you can explain the aspects you are looking for in the recorded video footage.  For instance, if we require to see all video from today that has a police car in it, we simply type cops" into the search window and in seconds every secret frame of video with a patrol car appears.
