Once again the sales individuals, or at least mine, do not point out the 3 year commitment. I called their client service team and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to mention it, it's on you to read the fine print.

<p>While you have to spend for cloud video storage on the Arlo Pro 3, it is among the more affordable subscriptions out there at $2.99 a month.
