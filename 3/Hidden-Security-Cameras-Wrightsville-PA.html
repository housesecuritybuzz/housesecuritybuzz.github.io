<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is an enjoyment to use too (a lot much better than the apps you get with some spending plan security cameras), though if you wish to get into its cleverest customisations, there is a bit of a learning curve. For all the more basic smarts, it's terrific, though.

This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools available which can release a dictionary style attack of "potentially accepted" security secrets based on the "model" security essential captured during the network recovery.</p>
