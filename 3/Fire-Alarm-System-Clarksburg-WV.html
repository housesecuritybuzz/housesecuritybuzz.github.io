<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can identify people the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those individuals and will send smartphone notifies with that information when they appear at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise found the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also offer a broader range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
