<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it supplies protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software to discover it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only an incorrect complacency since it avoids only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
