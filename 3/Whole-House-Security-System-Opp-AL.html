<p>Just recently, Ring rejected reports that it had actually suffered a data breach, however we agree with its suggestion that users must reset passwords and make it possible for two-factor authentication as a preventive step. All smart-home devices are susceptible to such incidents. However, after this newest entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have actually decided to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? section from our wise video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video products, we do not believe that these issues change the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain confident in our current suggestion.</p>
