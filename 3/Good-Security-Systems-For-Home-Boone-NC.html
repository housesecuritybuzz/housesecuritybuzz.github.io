<h3>Security Cameras For Home in Boone NC</h3>
<p>Video surveillance is cost efficient and scalable. As your business grows, including and incorporating extra cameras into a recognized network is cost-effective and easy.

Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we frequently found action missing, thanks to irregular and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
