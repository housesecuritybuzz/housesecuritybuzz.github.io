<p>Somewhat more costly than our winning smart alarm, this system was almost as easy to install and, during screening, the loud, clear siren was quick to sound if one of the sensors had actually been set off. We like that the system consists of a wifi security camera and only notifies you when motion is created by something with the same heat pattern as a human (making sure there's no incorrect alerts). However, you do require to sign up for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 per month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get signals on your phone if the sensors have actually been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are available that have additional sensing units and key fobs, too.</p>
