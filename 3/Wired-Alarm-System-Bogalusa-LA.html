When a patient pushes the emergency button, it sends dual alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. In addition, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the risk and, if needed, could just push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific flooring.</p>

<p>Somewhat more costly than our winning smart alarm, this system was almost as easy to install and, during screening, the loud, clear siren was quick to sound if one of the sensors had actually been set off. We like that the system consists of a wifi security camera and only notifies you when motion is created by something with the same heat pattern as a human (making sure there's no incorrect alerts). However, you do require to sign up for the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 per month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get signals on your phone if the sensors have actually been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are available that have additional sensing units and key fobs, too.</p>

Many cameras use IR (infrared) LEDs to provide black-and-white night video, however there are a few out there that use white light to provide full-color night video. Try to find a camera with a night vision variety of a minimum of 30 feet.</p>
