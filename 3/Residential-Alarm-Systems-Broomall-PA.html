<p>For these different systems to converge or to integrate them together into a single user interface, a comprehensive knowledge of all the needed systems is needed. There are just two choices if there are no as-built documents offering performance and configuration info to make this combination work. The first option, which may be the most complicated, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial solution provider is not available or unwilling to provide those details) and document the geography and how they can be included into the new DVS system. The other method is to rip and change, performing a total upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to converge them all.</p>

Their detectors use infrared innovation, so its more difficult for a pet dog or feline to journey the sensor. Vivint's sensors are unsusceptible to animals weighing approximately 33 to 55 pounds. Frontpoint's detectors are unsusceptible to pets weighing approximately 40 pounds. With ADT, the professional installer can tailor the sensitivity level based upon your animal's size. </p>
