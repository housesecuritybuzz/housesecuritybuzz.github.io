<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing video in the dark is a concern.</p>
