<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to identify any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensors to disregard items that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is set up to prevent this type of attack.</p>
