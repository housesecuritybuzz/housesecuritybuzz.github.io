<p>In the past, a surveillance security system typically included a number of cameras linked-- either hardwired or wireless-- to a digital video recorder (DVR), which recorded the images and showed them on a closed circuit tv (CCTV) or monitor. Nowadays, it's a lot easier to have a standalone security camera. Whether you have one camera or a number of, they work with your home's web network to send out video footage right to your computer or mobile phone. Most consumer cameras save information internally, on a removable microSD card, or from another location on the cloud.</p>
<p>IP security cameras record analog images and transform them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing capabilities like compression and motion detection. The recorded digital video stream is then transmitted over a local area network (LAN) using Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which records each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and review. The system can be set up to interact through network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
