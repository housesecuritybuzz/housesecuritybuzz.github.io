<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not especially revolutionary, so we're actually advising the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free strategy alternative. Sure, you get a lower price if you choose a three-year contract, however because Nest requires you to pay 100% of your remaining agreement if you cancel, it's a huge commitment. So choose what will be the better deal for you. Go with the agreement and reap those savings if you understand you'll remain put for at least 3 years. But if you may update to a new office with different security needs, contract-free is your best option.</p>
