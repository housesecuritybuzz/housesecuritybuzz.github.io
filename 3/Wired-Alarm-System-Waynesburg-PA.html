<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can determine individuals the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name.

We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a broader series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
