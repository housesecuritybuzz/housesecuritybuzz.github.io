<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has actually clearly tried to give it an appealing edge, and we need to give credit to its capability to show what's going on from up to 4 cameras at a time. It can be awkward and slow to use on occasion - with the process of linking to the camera for a live view rather languid sometimes.
