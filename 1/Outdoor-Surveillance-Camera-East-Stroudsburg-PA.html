<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do nowadays - you will probably be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the large quantity of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and often over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trustworthy, however not suitable with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the need for more wiring.
