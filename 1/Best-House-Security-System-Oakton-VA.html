<p>Vivint's monitoring charges remain in line with our other top security companies, which is impressive given the sophisticated exclusive equipment and services that feature a Vivint home security system.

<p>The downside to a wireless system is that it counts on a wireless signal, suggesting that storms and strong winds have the power to interfere with the system and might even activate false alarms.

Wireless equipment can also be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is generally balanced out by the truth that there are no installation costs.</p>
