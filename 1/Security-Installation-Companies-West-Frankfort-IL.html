It can be awkward and slow to utilize on celebration - with the process of linking to the camera for a live view rather sluggish at times. The previous, more affordable version of the outdoor Nest webcam is still on sale too if you want to save some money - it does have a cable television connected though, instead of working wirelessly, which means it's a bit simpler to screw up for prospective trespassers.
