<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, a lot of burglar alarms work the precise same method. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical current. When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If someone were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking enables the electrical existing to flow throughout the system, which implies when the doors are shut the alarm system will trigger.</p>
