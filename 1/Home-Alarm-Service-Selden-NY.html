<p>Are privately owned, ran surveillance cameras to be dealt with the same way as public cameras? We also require to draw fine lines about 'Who actually is viewing you'? 'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Big sibling? The Corporates? Or harassing neighbour? Who draws the line in between public interest and harassment? At the minute, nobody! The camera might legally do what a peeping tom might not do. They could peer inside of windows with the full protection of the law on their side. If a person was standing seeing outside a window it might be a crime, yet the very same person could put a surveillance camera then from another location see an individual within the personal privacy of their home. Most importantly, it is not versus the chastening code.</p>

However ADT isn't maintaining. It costs a lot, its prices isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to discuss that the customer service experience varies extensively depending upon the dealer you go with. </p>
