We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also afflicted with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (approximately 30 seconds) to connect to a live peek, frequently buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of approximately 90 seconds between videos.</p>
<p>You can view the camera's feed live from the app at any time, and it supports multiple cameras, so wiring up the whole home for under â‚¤ 100 is absolutely possible.
