Landline systems use traditional phone lines to communicate with the monitoring center and, similar to cellular systems, they generally have a battery backup to keep them working for a set time period.</p>
<p>A single monitor in the parking lot management office was connected to the output for monitoring cameras. The PCU provided shuffling of each camera feed and select intervals and a keyboard to input the call number for each camera, or the capability to scroll through each camera one by one. The Blink XT Home Security System features cameras that find motion and immediately sends out alerts with HD video and audio to your phone.</p>
<p>There's a couple of other cool functions in the camera itself such as an automated zoom which tracks moving objects if it detects an intruder; a convenient intercom function that permits the device to function as a smart doorbell (although it does not have a chime or button - for that you'll need the Nest Hey there doorbell ); and, because Alphabet owns Nest, the camera carries Google Assistant.</p>
