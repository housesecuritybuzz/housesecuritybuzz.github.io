It tapes high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is totally wireless, and can be set up both inside your home and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there.

<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically sophisticated outdoor camera we have actually tested. It has a close-up tracking feature, which immediately focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high dynamic variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between basic motion and individuals, so it minimizes false alarms, and it can even recognize people you have actually identified (after a knowing period). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
<p>Our experience with expert installation was mixed. Our tester stated the professional provided solid client service: He dropped a couple of unneeded window sensing units from my costs after choosing that the motion detector sufficed for the whole front half of my home." Nevertheless, there were some issues with connecting the command hub to our tester's network. </p>
