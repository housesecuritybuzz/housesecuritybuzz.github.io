With a professionally monitored system, the homeowner will be called by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it quickly. False alarms happen.

We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also pestered with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.
