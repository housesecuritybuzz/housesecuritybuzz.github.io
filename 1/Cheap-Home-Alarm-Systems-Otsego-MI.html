<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you wish to leave the agreement you have to pay 75% of the contract.  So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no concept I was in, to go out I need to pay $783.  Truly frustrating. Again the sales people, or at least mine, do not discuss the 3 year commitment. I called their customer care team and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not have to mention it, it's on you to check out the small print. I'm paying the lump amount, because apparently they auto renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send in a written not by mail.  ADT is a problem, way too pricey, and not fantastic.</p>

<p>Remember that Nest cameras aren't professionally monitored-- that part's on you. (The remainder of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.)

<p>Some wireless home security systems offer a video recording storage option and others do not. For the ones that do not, you are able to see a live video feed of your home any time you access your system; however, absolutely nothing is tape-recorded. The systems with video storage usually consist of either a local storage or cloud storage option. A local storage choice conserves a pre-determined variety of video clips on the device itself. This choice is normally cost-free. A cloud storage option conserves your video clips in the cloud. Nevertheless, this is typically a paid service and the number of hours it will save will depend upon just how much cloud storage you are willing to pay for.</p>
<p>The report, entitled Is your CCTV system secure from cyber attack?, states there are "major vulnerabilities" in both conventional DVR-based CCTV systems, as well as cloud-based video systems. Hackers can "quickly" pirate connections to the gadget's IP address, putting a great deal of people, their homes and data at risk. </p>
