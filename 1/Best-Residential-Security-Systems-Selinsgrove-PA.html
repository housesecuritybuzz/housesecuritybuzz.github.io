Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to detect any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge.
