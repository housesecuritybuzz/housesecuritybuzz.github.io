<p>If you do come across a home invasion emergency, you can set off the 80dB alarm. I am somewhat dissatisfied by the volume of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food mill whereas numerous other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB or perhaps 105dB. Regardless of that, the alarm ought to be enough to frighten intruders most of the times.
