Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limits, we often found action missing out on, thanks to irregular and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
