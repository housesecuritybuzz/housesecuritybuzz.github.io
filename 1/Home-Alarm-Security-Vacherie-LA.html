The clever bit is that the camera not just spots that people have entered its 130-degree visual field, however it will also have a stab at recognising them too. Maybe more usefully, if somebody passes who the camera does not understand, you get an alert about an "unknown face". You can tell the system who it is (if it's not an intruder), and next time around it must instantly understand.</p>
<p>Cameras typically transmit footage online, allowing operators to monitor security camera feeds remotely. In some cases, surveillance systems are paid for and operated by the cities themselves.
