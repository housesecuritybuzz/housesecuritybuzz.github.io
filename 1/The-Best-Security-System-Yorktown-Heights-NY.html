<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a brief description of how thermal cameras work: All objects release infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature level. The infrared energy produced by an object is referred to as its heat signature. In basic, the hotter an item is, the more radiation it discharges. A thermal camera includes a heat sensor that can finding tiny differences in temperature. The gadget gathers the infrared radiation from things in the scene and produces an electronic image based upon info about the temperature level differences. Since things are seldom specifically the same temperature as other items around them, a thermal camera can discover them, and they will look like distinct in a thermal image.</p>

<p>Due to the fact that they work using a digital signal which can be saved straight to a computer, these cameras do not need a video capture card. The signal is compressed 5:1, but DVD quality can be achieved with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a greater compression ratio than 5:1, with a slightly lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the quantity of area to be used up versus the quality of image required or wanted). The highest photo quality of DVD is only a little lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>
