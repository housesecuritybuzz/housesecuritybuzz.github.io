<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally regular given that the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
