All smart-home devices are susceptible to such incidents.

If you prepare to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? section from our smart video doorbell guide.

<p>It would be easy to roll your eyes at this last point, but it means you can ask your home security camera for the weather report - or whatever Google search takes your fancy - and a speaker within the system will reply. It likewise indicates that if you really saw a burglar riffle through your home, you could rapidly tape a message to him or her through your smart device, and the Nest would play it aloud.
