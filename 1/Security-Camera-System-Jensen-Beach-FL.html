<p>However monitored systems also tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey monthly charge for a set quantity of time, generally one to 5 years. No-contract systems, which permit you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than dedicating to a long-lasting plan, are becoming more typical. These systems in some cases cost more up front for the hardware than professional systems that provide a discount rate in exchange for that lengthy service arrangement.

<p>When it comes to technology, reliability is an extremely subjective matter, depending on which features and benefits a specific favors. Wireless security systems are more integratable and nimble, but low signal strength and poor connectivity are still common problems.
