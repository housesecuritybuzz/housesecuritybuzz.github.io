<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never ever matches the producer's stats given that this comes from tests in a controlled environment without constant video recording, which is the most significant offender for short battery life without a doubt.

<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, most burglar alarms work the exact same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electrical current. When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which suggests if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be moved. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door permits the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>
