<p>There is a new trend in surveillance video search innovation that is quickly altering the security market, and it is called Deep Knowing". What is Deep Learning and why is it so essential?  For starters, Deep Knowing allows someone to discover what they are searching for without needing to explore hours of useless video footage.  Imagine a web page that works a lot like a Google search, where you can describe the elements you are trying to find in the recorded video footage.  For example, if we need to see all video from today that has a patrol car in it, we merely type cops" into the search window and in seconds every key frame of video with a police cruiser appears.  With deep learning video search, you now have a powerful service for gathering and capturing lawbreakers proof.</p>
<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we might point them at the exact same spot and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had installed on the porch by a licensed electrical contractor (who takes place to be my hubby). All of the cameras were connected to the exact same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router indoors (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to your home was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize people the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those people and will send smart device signals with that details when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate predicted visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a nearby TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a wider variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
