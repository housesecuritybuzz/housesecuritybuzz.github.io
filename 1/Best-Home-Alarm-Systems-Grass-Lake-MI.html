Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for more circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may need less circuitry in the walls however will still need cable televisions to power the security camera separately, normally by means of 110VAC power. </p>
