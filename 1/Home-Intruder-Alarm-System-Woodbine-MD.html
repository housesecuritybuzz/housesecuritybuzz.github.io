<p>A tight wire boundary security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to spot any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to disregard things that apply percentages of pressure on the wires.
