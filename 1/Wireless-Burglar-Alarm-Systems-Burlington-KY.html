<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we might point them at the exact same spot and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting components, which I had set up on the deck by a certified electrical expert (who occurs to be my hubby).

<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can determine individuals the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those individuals and will send smart device informs with that info when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise discovered the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also supply a broader variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
