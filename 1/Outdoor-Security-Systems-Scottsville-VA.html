<p>The best home security systems have professional monitoring. We know it's an extra expenditure monthly, but we generally advise it.

Although there's no alternative for professional installation, not just does Ring make things as simple as possible, this is simply another cost you don't need to fret about.</p>
<p>The upfront cost of wireless security systems can be expensive. Consider the in advance cost of the control board, activation fees, monitoring costs and all equipment.
