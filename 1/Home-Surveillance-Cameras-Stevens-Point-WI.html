<p>The Blink XT2 is small, operates on two AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of free cloud storage, and it records a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a pick? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smart device notices and live views were painfully sluggish, and the variety is poor. Likewise, if the camera is in the middle of recording, do not expect to get a live peek or make any settings changes-- it can't multitask.</p>
