<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, a lot of burglar alarms work the specific same method. They use open and closed circuits to move an electric existing. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If somebody were to open the door that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking permits the electrical existing to stream throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will trigger.</p>
