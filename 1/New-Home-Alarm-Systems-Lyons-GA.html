When a patient pushes the emergency situation button, it sends double alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Additionally, if the central patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the threat and, if required, could simply push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific flooring.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal since the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as customers recognize that the affordable customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
