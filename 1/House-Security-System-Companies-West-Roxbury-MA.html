<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal given that the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as customers realize that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
