<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were remarkable in our testing-- throughout the day and in the evening-- with a large, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We need to note that the camera would sometimes downgrade the photo quality based upon offered bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day.
