<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as customers recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
