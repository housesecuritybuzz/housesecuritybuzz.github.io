When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those people and will send smartphone signals with that details when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate anticipated visitors from random strangers. We likewise discovered the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
