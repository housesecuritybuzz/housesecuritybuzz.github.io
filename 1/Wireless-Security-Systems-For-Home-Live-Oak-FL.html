When you envision a home security camera, it's far from the ghastly metal CCTV box that you might call to mind. The first wireless function to consider is the security system and its components, and how they all connect. In the past, every monitoring component was hard-wired back to a panel box.

<p>The majority of outdoor cameras, like the Arlo Ultra, use motion detection with push and e-mail alerts, night vision, and cloud storage for event-triggered video, and some, like the Ring Floodlight Camera, pull double duty as floodlights or deck lights. Some designs can even tell the difference in between a passing vehicle, an animal, and a person.

For fixing, you have the choice of either a strong magnetic ball install or a standard tripod screw.</p>
