<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely regular considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as consumers realize that the low-cost customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
<p>When your video cameras are installed, you can pick whether or not your cameras will be monitored by the central station. If you choose to have your cameras monitored (this is typically done for cameras that are monitoring outdoor locations), then yes, main station operators will see the video that is recorded when an alarm is set off. However, you may pick to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is usually done for cameras that are monitoring indoor, residential areas). Cameras that are not monitored by the main station can not be accessed our operators for any factor, even if asked for by the consumer. </p>
