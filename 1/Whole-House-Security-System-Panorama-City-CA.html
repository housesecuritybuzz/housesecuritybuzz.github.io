<p>What truly sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be costly but is essential.

Having the ability to compare a cars and truck and an individual, for example, allows you to reduce unnecessary signals. And Activity Zones are a good perk, particularly if you're wanting to monitor a specific corner of the backyard, an entrance, and even trash bin. </p>
