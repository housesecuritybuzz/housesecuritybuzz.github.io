<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your home so we could point them at the exact same spot and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting components, which I had actually set up on the patio by a licensed electrical contractor (who happens to be my hubby). All of the cameras were linked to the exact same 2.4 GHz network through a Wi-Fi router indoors (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>Basically, wireless security systems rely on cellular signals to work - while wired systems work utilizing radio frequency. With wireless security, your cameras, sensors, lights and other security equipment are all linked to one base station or panel to receive sensors required to manage your equipment including enabling, disabling and sending you instantaneous alerts. When a signal is gotten, you'll get an alert from the security provider's mobile app, web, text, or e-mail portal. They'll also receive an alert to right away help you with emergency situation responders as needed if your wireless home security system is professionally monitored. </p>
