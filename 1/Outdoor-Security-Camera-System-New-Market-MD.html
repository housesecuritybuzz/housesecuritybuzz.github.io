<p>Contact among our security specialists with any concerns you may have about home alarm monitoring. While it might come as a surprise, burglar alarms have been around for over 150 years.

And Activity Zones are a great perk, particularly if you're wanting to monitor a specific corner of the yard, a doorway, or perhaps garbage cans. </p>
