<p>Contact among our security specialists with any concerns you may have about home alarm monitoring. While it might come as a surprise, burglar alarms have been around for over 150 years.

Without it, you won't get the person-detection function, personalized Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, an in-depth, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera discovered activity. Being able to compare an individual and an automobile, for instance, allows you to reduce unnecessary signals. And Activity Zones are a great perk, particularly if you're wanting to monitor a specific corner of the yard, a doorway, or perhaps garbage cans. </p>
