<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, typically referred to as shock sensing units, are different because they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Normally, the most intense frequencies produced are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending upon the type of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>

<p>Some wireless home security systems provide a video recording storage alternative and others do not. For the ones that do not, you have the ability to see a live video feed of your home any time you access your system; however, nothing is recorded. The systems with video storage typically consist of either a local storage or cloud storage alternative. A local storage alternative saves a pre-determined variety of video clips on the device itself. This choice is usually cost-free. A cloud storage option saves your video in the cloud. Nevertheless, this is generally a paid service and the variety of hours it will keep will depend on how much cloud storage you are willing to pay for.</p>

It costs a lot, its rates isn't always transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to discuss that the customer service experience differs extensively depending on the dealer you choose. </p>
