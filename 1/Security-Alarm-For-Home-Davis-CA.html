<h3>Security House System Davis CA 95616</h3>
<p>So far so typical. Things begin to get truly fascinating with the Nest's facial recognition system. If the camera finds a face it does not acknowledge, it will send out a notice and image to your phone, allowing you to give that person the twice. If it's somebody getting up to no good, the camera will follow their movements and conserve the timestamp, so you can easily discover it in the future.

<p>The Canary Flex includes a smart variation that sends out alerts directly to your phone if you're looking for motion detection. This camera uses a variety of functions consisting of a 360-degree swiveling base. Last time I evaluated a Swann camera I described it as decidedly middle of the road.
