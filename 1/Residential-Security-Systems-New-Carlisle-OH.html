<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak to an existing network should be within 300 feet for ideal performance. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera close to the NVR is definitely something to be considered. For instance if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a problem but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on second story wall, this would trigger a disturbance in the signal. A wireless bridge is a fantastic option for long range scenarios where trees and poles are not present.</p>

<p>However, in any circumstance where standard-definition video cameras are used, the quality is going to be bad due to the fact that the optimum pixel resolution of the image chips in the majority of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is measured in TELEVISION lines but the outcomes are the very same); they typically record vertical and horizontal fields of lines and blend them together to make a single frame; the maximum frame rate is typically 30 frames per second.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal considering that the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as clients recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
