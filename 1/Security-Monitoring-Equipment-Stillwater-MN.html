<p>Nevertheless, in any scenario where standard-definition video cameras are utilized, the quality is going to be poor due to the fact that the optimum pixel resolution of the image chips in the majority of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is determined in TV lines but the outcomes are the very same); they usually capture vertical and horizontal fields of lines and mix them together to make a single frame; the maximum frame rate is generally 30 frames per second.</p>
<p>With a boost in data and much better tools for analysis, video surveillance is moving from reactive to proactive - SMG can help your business arrive. The need for a convergence of information and video has enabled users these days's video management systems to react rapidly to important occasions, understand how their organization operates, as well as how their consumers act.

<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize people the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those individuals and will send out smart device notifies with that details when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a nearby TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also offer a wider variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
