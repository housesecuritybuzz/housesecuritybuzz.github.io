<h2>CCTV Security Cameras & Video Surveillance Sanford</h2>
<p>Analog security cameras transfer lower resolution video over coax cable television and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can handle such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom. The DVR converts the analog signal to digital, compresses it, and after that stores it on a hard disk for later retrieval. Monitors can be connected to the DVR for seeing, or the system can be set up to communicate by means of network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
