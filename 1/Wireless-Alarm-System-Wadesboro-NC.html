<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the big quantity of data required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and frequently over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reputable, however not suitable with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for additional electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less electrical wiring in the walls however will still need cable televisions to power the security camera independently, usually by means of 110VAC power. </p>
