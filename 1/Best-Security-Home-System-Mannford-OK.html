We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also pestered with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (up to 30 seconds) to connect to a live peek, typically buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of as much as 90 seconds between videos.</p>
