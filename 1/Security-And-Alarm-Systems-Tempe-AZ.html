We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced features, such as notices that compare individuals and general motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>

Fair warning: You'll probably have to fine-tune the sound level of sensitivity settings to avoid signals from barking dogs, loud automobiles, and other random noises.</p>
