<p>The density of access points can even be an issue - there are a minimal number of channels readily available, and they partially overlap. Each channel can deal with several networks, however places with lots of private wireless networks (for example, apartment complexes), the minimal variety of Wi-Fi radio channels may cause sluggishness and other problems.</p>

<p>Another essential subject to discuss is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand just how much is enough. In this article, the term resolution" refers to the variety of dots (pixels) that comprise a video photo; the more dots, the more comprehensive the video image. The same holds true of high-resolution Television Set, and the 2 most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution contains about 4 times as much image info as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also manufactured in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. There are some challenging consequences to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not constantly better.</p>
