<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely typical because the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when clients understand that the low-cost customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
