<p>The Piper NV is first and foremost a camera. It uses night vision and a wide-angle view so you can utilize one camera to monitor a big area. Through the mobile app, you can stream live video of your home and even use two-way audio to interact with others.

<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were impressive in our testing-- during the day and during the night-- with a broad, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We ought to note that the camera would occasionally downgrade the picture quality based on available bandwidth, which might fluctuate throughout the day. Nest consists of the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that may defeat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
