The scientists searched for CCTV examinations released in between 2007 and 2017 to account for the duration given that the last review (which covered examinations completed in 2006 and earlier). Techniques included searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of CCTV examination study bibliographies, forward searches of CCTV examinations, and calling leading scientists to inquire about upcoming assessments. Both published and unpublished reports were included in the search, which was not restricted to the English language and was worldwide in scope.</p>

In many cases, Geographic Details Systems technology is utilized to exactly evaluate criminal offense patterns for camera positioning; nevertheless, the positioning of cameras can also be the result of input from police officers and other criminal justice stakeholders (La Vigne et al. 2011).</p>
