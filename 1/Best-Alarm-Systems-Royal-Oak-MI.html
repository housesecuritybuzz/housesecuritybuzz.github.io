<p>Recently, Ring rejected reports that it had suffered a data breach, however we concur with its suggestion that users ought to reset passwords and enable two-factor authentication as a precautionary procedure. All smart-home devices are susceptible to such incidents. However, after this newest entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have decided to pull our suggestion of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? section from our smart video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video products, we do not think that these problems change the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain positive in our present suggestion.</p>
