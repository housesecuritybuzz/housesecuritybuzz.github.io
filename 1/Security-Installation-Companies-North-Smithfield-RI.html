Its monitoring service consists of an advantage called ASAPer, which all at once messages a group of pre-set contacts to determine whether alarm activity is a real emergency situation or false alarm.

<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see in the evening. If catching video in the dark is a concern, make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>Deciding which surveillance cameras will work best in a particular environment is easiest when the advantages and downsides of each camera are understood. When comparing camera types and prices, keep the following 3 consider mind.
