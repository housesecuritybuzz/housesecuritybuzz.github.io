<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular given that the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as clients understand that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
