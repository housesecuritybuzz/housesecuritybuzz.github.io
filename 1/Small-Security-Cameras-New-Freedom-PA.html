<p>Nevermind how great the cameras are. The first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your data to 3rd party companies? I have actually dropped my Nest Cams given that they were purchased by Google. Something all of us require to think of. Sirens. So your camera has actually detected intruders or wild animals.
