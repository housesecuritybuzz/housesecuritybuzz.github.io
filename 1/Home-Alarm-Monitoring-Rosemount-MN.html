The majority of even permit you to communicate with whoever is on-camera as the action is taking place, via an ingrained microphone and speaker.</p>
<p>Another benefit to monitored systems is if you buy a monitored security plan, the exact same company that keeps track of the system will install it for you. If you're not mechanically likely, having a professional established the system might give you more confidence than if you did the work yourself. Wireless cameras can't have it all-- watch things inside by day, and keep an eye on what's going on outside after dark. It seldom works.</p>
