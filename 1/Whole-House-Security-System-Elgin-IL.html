You get 1080p HD streaming, a 130-degree field of vision, the usual movement informs, and a 90+ dB alarm that is likely to scare off any approaching burglar prior to they have actually got too far into your home. When you're at home and don't desire to be taped, the privacy-conscious will be pleased to hear there's a physical shutter you can close over the camera.</p>
