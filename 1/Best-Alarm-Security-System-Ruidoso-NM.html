<p>The Blink XT2 is small, runs on two AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of free cloud storage, and it catches a better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smart device alerts and live views were painfully slow, and the variety is bad.

<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by a professional home security company. When the system identifies a burglary, fire, or other emergency situation, it alerts the security team and, sometimes, emergency responders.

Given all of the other benefits, it's simple to see why a lot of people are choosing this choice. </p>
