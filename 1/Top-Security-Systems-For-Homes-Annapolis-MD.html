<p>Most intruders enter your home or business when you aren't around. The come throughout the day, when you're likely to be at work or running errands. Far from dressing in a black catsuit, like you might have learned from the films, they'll wear a plain-clothes clothing to blend in. Especially smart criminals will camouflage themselves as service or delivery personnel. They do not spend excessive quantities of time rifling through your possessions.

<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can identify people the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those individuals and will send smart device signals with that details when they appear at your home. We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
