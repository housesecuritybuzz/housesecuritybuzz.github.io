It's fantastic for a car park or a warehouse, where the finer details aren't as important as the overall image.

<p>The cover of darkness isn't enough to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view. The one time where lag does become a little an issue is between detecting and taping movement. It takes a 2nd for the camera to in fact turn on when it spots motion due to the fact that the Pro 2 doesn't do continuous video recording. If a nefarious criminal was quickly enough, they could get past the camera before it had time to tape them.</p>
<p>I explained that all we would need to do is tap into any one of the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, which camera would become the interface into the VMS system. When a patient pushes the emergency situation button, it sends out double notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Additionally, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the danger and, if needed, could merely press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular flooring.</p>
