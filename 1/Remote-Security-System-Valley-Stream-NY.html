<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to sign in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We initially discovered Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E Once we attempted it out, it rapidly ended up being a staff (and friends and family) favorite. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a sound maker.
