<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that compare people and general motion. We think that's pricey.</p>
<p>When motion is discovered, nearly all outdoor security cameras are geared up with a motion sensor that will set off the camera to tape video. The sensing unit can also initiate a push alert to your phone when activity is taking place, and some will also generate an email alert. For an extra layer of security, try to find a camera with sound detection that can let you know if somebody is out there even if they run out range of the camera lens and the motion sensor. Fair caution: You'll probably need to fine-tune the sound sensitivity settings to avoid notifies from barking pet dogs, loud cars, and other random noises.</p>
