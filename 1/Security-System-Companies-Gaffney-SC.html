<p>You can activate the 80dB alarm if you do encounter a home intrusion emergency. I am somewhat disappointed by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it has to do with as loud as a food mill whereas many other alarm are as loud as 90dB or perhaps 105dB. Regardless of that, the alarm must suffice to scare away trespassers for the most part.
