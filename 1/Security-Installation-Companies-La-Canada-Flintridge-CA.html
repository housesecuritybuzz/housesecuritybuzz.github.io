It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced features, such as alerts that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
