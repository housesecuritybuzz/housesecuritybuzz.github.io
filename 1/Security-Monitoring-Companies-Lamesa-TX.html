<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion activates.</p>

That indicates even if you do not pay the regular monthly cost, the system will still signal you through your mobile phone if it finds a threat, but you are accountable for getting in touch with emergency situation services such as the police or fire department-- so your phone needs to stay on and you need to be happy to field alerts, even at 2:00 a.m. It's nice that the system has a monitoring option, however, in case you do not always want that duty, such as when you're on vacation.</p>
