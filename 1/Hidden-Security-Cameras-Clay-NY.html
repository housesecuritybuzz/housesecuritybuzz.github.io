<p>DITEK's alarm system surge protectors safeguard your security system versus transient surges that can enter through A/C power lines, telephone lines and remote notice zones. Alarm associations recommend that incorrect burglar alarms are not uniformly distributed: some alarm experience no incorrect alarms, and others, lots of. In some jurisdictions, the pattern of incorrect alarms is far more widely dispersed. â€  Whether concentrated throughout locations or not, the aggregate number of false alarm calls among all alarmed facilities places a high need on restricted authorities resources.</p>
<p>A system that requires an agreement may be a wise option for those who are cash-strapped or don't want to pay for the equipment up-front. Why?

We've seen 1-year, all the way up to 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you do not wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term contract (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>
