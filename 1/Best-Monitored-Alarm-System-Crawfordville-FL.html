<p>The Frontpoint Security system, in addition to its Interactive strategy, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and features are almost similar to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's plans are a little more costly for the exact same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation fees are burdensome, and its rates is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyhow.</p>
<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see during the night. If capturing video in the dark is a concern, ensure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
