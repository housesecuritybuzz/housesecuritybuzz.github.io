<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item classification is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security specialists looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. The clever bit is that the camera not just identifies that people have entered its 130-degree field of vision, however it will also have a stab at acknowledging them too.

<p>With an expertly monitored system, when a smoke or intrusion alarm is activated, a representative will first attempt to reach you via the two-way control board before calling your noted contact number.

With most DIY systems, such as the SimpliSafe Home Security Package, the Ring Alarm Security Package, and the Nest Secure, you buy the hardware outright and can prevent any month-to-month charges if you decide to self-monitor. If you add monitoring, charges will vary: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 per month for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 monthly. If you commit to a three-year agreement, the cost of the Nest service drops to $19 each month. Ring's Protect Plus plan opts for $10 monthly and does not need an agreement.</p>
