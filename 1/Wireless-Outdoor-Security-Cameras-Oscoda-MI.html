<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product classification is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security experts looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. The smart bit is that the camera not just finds that people have entered its 130-degree visual field, but it will likewise have a stab at recognising them too. Perhaps more usefully, if somebody passes who the camera does not understand, you get an alert about an "unknown face". You can inform the system who it is (if it's not an intruder), and next time around it should immediately know.</p>
<p>Lastly, I check out a home security system's app, making sure it's technically sound and easy to use, especially if there is home automation included. I likewise inspect app reviews from the Apple and the Google Play shops, searching for home security apps with rankings of a minimum of three stars or above.
