<p>When using IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the big amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and frequently over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trusted, however not suitable with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the requirement for additional electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera individually, typically through 110VAC power. </p>
