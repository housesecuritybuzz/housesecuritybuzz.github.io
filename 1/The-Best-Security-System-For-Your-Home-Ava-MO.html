On the simpler side, with SimpliSafe, you trade the bells and whistles of wise home equipment for versatility and low prices. SimpliSafe does have a video doorbell with two-way audio, however you can't include a lots of other smart home tech to the system. It will not work with loads of smart home equipment from other companies.

Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint doesn't have an agreement, and its equipment pricing is incredibly sensible, so it's not a total splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>
