<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that distinguish between people and basic motion. We think that's pricey.</p>
