<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize people the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name.

We also found the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a broader range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
