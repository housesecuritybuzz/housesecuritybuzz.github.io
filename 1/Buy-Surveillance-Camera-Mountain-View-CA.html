<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see in the evening. If capturing footage in the dark is a concern, make certain your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>

This extra cost isn't ideal, however when compared to the Frontpoint and Vivint $40-and $45- respective minimum prices monthly for monitoring, Scout Alarm is a steal. </p>
