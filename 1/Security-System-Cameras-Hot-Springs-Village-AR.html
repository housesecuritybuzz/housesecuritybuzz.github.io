<p>Another essential subject to go over is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to understand how much is enough.

The very same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about 4 times as much photo details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also made in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no.
