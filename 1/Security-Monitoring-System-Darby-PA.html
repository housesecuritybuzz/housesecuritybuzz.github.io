Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we often found action missing, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
