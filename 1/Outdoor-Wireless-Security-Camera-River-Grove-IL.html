<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can identify individuals the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those individuals and will send smart device signals with that information when they appear at your home.

We likewise found the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) likewise supply a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
