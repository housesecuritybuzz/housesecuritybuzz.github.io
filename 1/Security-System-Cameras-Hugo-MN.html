Dependability has long been at the heart of the argument over wireless versus hardwired home security systems. It's an argument that's typically skewed by elements such as skepticism over the susceptibility of wireless systems, consisting of interference from radio signals and problems that trigger incorrect alarms.

Fair caution: You'll most likely have to tweak the sound sensitivity settings to prevent informs from barking dogs, loud cars, and other random noises.</p>
