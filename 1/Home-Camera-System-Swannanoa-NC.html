Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free strategy alternative. Sure, you get a lower cost if you choose a three-year contract, however because Nest requires you to pay 100% of your remaining contract if you cancel, it's a huge dedication. So select what will be the better offer for you. If you understand you'll sit tight for at least 3 years, go with the contract and gain those cost savings.
