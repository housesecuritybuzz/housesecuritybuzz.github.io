<p>Camera compatibility: Not every video recorder can work with every camera. Obviously, DVRs require analog cameras, while NVRs use IP cameras, but the compatibility concern extends well beyond that difference. Some NVR systems, for example, are compatible with the IP cameras just from particular makers and not others. When buying a video recorder, you need to initially ensure that the device will work with the cameras you've acquired.
