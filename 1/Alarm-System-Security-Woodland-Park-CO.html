<p>The disadvantage to a wireless system is that it counts on a wireless signal, indicating that storms and strong winds have the power to interfere with the system and might even activate false alarms. False alarms are understood to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could result in fines from the provider or the police if they happen regularly enough. Another prospective drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment must be replaced or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is normally offset by the truth that there are no installation expenses.</p>
<p>When it concerns technology, reliability is a highly subjective matter, depending on which functions and advantages an individual favors. Wireless security systems are more integratable and agile, however low signal strength and poor connectivity are still typical grievances. Hardwired systems require minimal maintenance, and except a basic power outage, are harder to interrupt. In spite of a basic improvement in wireless innovation, there appear to be fewer methods for hardwired systems to be interrupted and disarmed. </p>
