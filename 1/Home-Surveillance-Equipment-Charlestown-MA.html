Modern systems now have extraordinary capabilities", though these have developed understandable misgivings about the threat for personal privacy and potential abuse such abilities develop.

When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those individuals and will send out smart device signals with that details when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to distinguish expected visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
