<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize individuals the camera is identifying utilizing face acknowledgment. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those individuals and will send out smartphone signals with that details when they show up at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to differentiate expected visitors from random strangers. We likewise discovered the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a wider series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
