<p>The Frontpoint Security system, along with its Interactive strategy, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and features are nearly similar to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's strategies are somewhat more costly for the exact same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation costs are difficult, and its rates is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyway.</p>
<p>For instance, the bullet cameras with fixed lens are normally smaller sized than those with zoom lens. SimpliSafe has the most remarkable action time of all home security companies we examined.
