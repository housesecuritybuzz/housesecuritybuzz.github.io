<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are relied on by more than 60,000 services, universities, and government centers, and residential consumers. Non-traditional networks such as individual network Bluetooth devices are not safe from hacking and must be considered a security threat. Even barcode readers, handheld PDAs, and wireless printers and photo copiers need to be protected. These non-traditional networks can be quickly overlooked by IT personnel who have actually narrowly focused on laptop computers and access points.</p>
<p>A system that requires a contract might be a wise option for those who are cash-strapped or don't wish to spend for the equipment up-front. Why?

We've seen 1-year, all the method approximately 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you don't wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term agreement (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>
