Assistance for an automation service such as IFTTT or Stringify is likewise useful. This allows the camera or monitor to respond to various scenarios, such as taking an image when your Nest Protect discovers smoke, or telling your Philips Color smart bulb to switch on when unanticipated sounds are found.</p>
