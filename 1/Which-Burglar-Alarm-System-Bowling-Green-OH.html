<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that distinguish between people and basic motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
