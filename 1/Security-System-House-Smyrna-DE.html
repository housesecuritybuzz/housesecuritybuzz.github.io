<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize people the camera is finding using face acknowledgment. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those individuals and will send mobile phone informs with that info when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to differentiate predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also supply a wider variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
