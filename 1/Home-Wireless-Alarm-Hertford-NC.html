After a while, the camera will find out to determine those people and will send smartphone notifies with that information when they show up at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify expected visitors from random strangers. We likewise discovered the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also offer a larger range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
