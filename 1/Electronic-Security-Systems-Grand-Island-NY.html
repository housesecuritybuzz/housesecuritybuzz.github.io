<p>Primarily, it's hard to hate the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other choices, however it's much better than a great deal of cameras that are 4 times the price. The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after practically 2 years of day, night and usage images have always been clear, and we never had problems with the camera missing out on motion, an issue we came across when evaluating the Wyze Webcam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a clever feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It develops a green, on-screen box around the motion detected.

We like that the system consists of a wifi security camera and just informs you when motion is developed by something with the very same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no false alerts). However, you do require to register for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 per month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get notifies on your phone if the sensors have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are offered that have key fobs and extra sensing units, too.</p>
