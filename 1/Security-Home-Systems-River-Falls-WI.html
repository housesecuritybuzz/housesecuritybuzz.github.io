<p>Just recently, Ring denied reports that it had actually suffered a data breach, but we agree with its recommendation that users must reset passwords and enable two-factor authentication as a precautionary measure. All smart-home gadgets are susceptible to such occurrences. However, after this latest entry in a year-long series of controversial media reports, we have actually chosen to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first check out the What about Ring? area from our clever video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it comes to video items, we don't think that these problems alter the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay positive in our current recommendation.</p>
