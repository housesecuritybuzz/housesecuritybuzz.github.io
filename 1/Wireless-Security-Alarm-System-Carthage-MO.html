<p>Six basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Property protection gadgets are designed to protect particular, concrete assets, such as fashion jewelry, paintings, money boxes, and household heirlooms. These gadgets can be outfitted with anti-tampering technology to prevent being disarmed.

<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids speaking to somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are fairly typical. If a property owner forgets their keys and returns inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is set off by a community cat, it can trigger the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the house owner will be called by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it rapidly. False alarms happen.

Flood lights can hinder vandals or scare them away, however as a single piece of equipment, they are more for your peace of mind than for home protection.</p>
