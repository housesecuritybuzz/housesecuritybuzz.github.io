<p>The Frontpoint Security system, in addition to its Interactive plan, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and features are almost identical to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's strategies are somewhat more pricey for the exact same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation charges are difficult, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyhow.</p>

It has a close-up tracking feature, which immediately focuses on motion and then follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare general motion and people, so it minimizes false alarms, and it can even identify people you've identified (after a knowing duration). However like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>

Brinks likewise offers home automation, which permits you to use your system as a hub for other smart devices, like automated locks and voice assistants.
