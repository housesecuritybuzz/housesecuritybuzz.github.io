All smart-home devices are susceptible to such incidents.

If you prepare to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? section from our clever video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video items, we don't believe that these issues modify the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain positive in our current recommendation.</p>
