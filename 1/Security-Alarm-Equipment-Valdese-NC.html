<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between people and general motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
