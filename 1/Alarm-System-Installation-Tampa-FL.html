<p>We tried each of the cameras in multiple locations around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet far from our Wi-Fi router, which was connected to Verizon Fios service.

Although FrontPoint uses a wide array of equipment and home automation products at an affordable price, the one location where the company especially stands out is in DIY installation. </p>
