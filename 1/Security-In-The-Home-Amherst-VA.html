<p>While every property owner worries about break-ins, hesitation has surrounded home security systems due to their generally high expenses, complicated contracts with long-lasting lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces typically leading to false alarms. A security camera system is a whole video surveillance system linked together by a series of security cameras and network video recorders, providing reliable video monitoring around your home and business. 145 years back, we invented security and alarm monitoring services.

When the magnet is moved away from the reed switch, the reed switch either closes or opens, again based upon whether the design is typically open or normally closed. This action coupled with an electric present (usually at 12V DC) enables an alarm control board to identify a fault on that zone or circuit.
