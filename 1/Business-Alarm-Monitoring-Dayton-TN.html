I have actually dropped my Nest Cams since they were purchased by Google. Something all of us require to think about. Sirens. So your camera has discovered burglars or wild animals. Do you wish to scare them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will work. Keep in mind that these sirens might breach local noise control laws, so check ahead of time prior to making the purchase.</p>
