<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can identify people the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment.

After a while, the camera will discover to determine those people and will send out smartphone signals with that details when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
