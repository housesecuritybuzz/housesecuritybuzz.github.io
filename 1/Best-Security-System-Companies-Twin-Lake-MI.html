<p>A taut wire border security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to identify any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to overlook objects that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires.
