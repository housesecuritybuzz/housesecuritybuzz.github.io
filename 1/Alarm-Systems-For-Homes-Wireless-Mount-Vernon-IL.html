<p>Nothing is more crucial than securing what you treasure most ... your family and home. The implicit validation for the current push to increase video surveillance is the hazard of terrorist attacks. But suicide assaulters are clearly not discouraged by camera - and may even be drawn in to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the expense of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up around 20 percent of that country's criminal justice budget - far exceeds the minimal advantages that the system may provide in examining attacks or attempted attacks after the fact (see reality sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
