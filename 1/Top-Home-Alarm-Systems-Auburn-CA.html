<p>Unlike standard alarm systems, which have a control board (normally situated in the entryway hall) that is utilized to disarm the alarm and arm and alert you if any sensing units have been triggered, smart alarms are managed from a smart device app. The app lets you arm and deactivate the alarm, even if you've currently left home, and notifies you if any of the sensing units have actually been triggered, rather than getting home to find your siren has been sounding all afternoon (and potentially annoying your neighbours).

<p>One crucial exception: ADT has a landline monitoring plan that's $36.99 per month, which might be an economical alternative for clients in rural areas. We recommend cellular systems since they're much more secure than landline systems, however there are some places where cellular monitoring isn't readily available. A landline system is still much better than no security at all if you live someplace without access to cellular monitoring.</p>
<p>In addition to the system itself, security alarms are typically paired with a monitoring service. In case of an alarm, the premises manage system contacts a main monitoring station. Operators at the station see the signal and take appropriate action, such as calling homeowner, alerting police, or dispatching private security forces. Such signals may be sent via dedicated alarm circuits, telephone lines, or the web.</p>
