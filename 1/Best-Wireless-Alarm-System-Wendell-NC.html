<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has clearly tried to give it an attractive edge, and we have to provide credit to its ability to show what's going on from up to 4 cameras at a time. It can be sluggish and awkward to use on celebration - with the process of linking to the camera for a live view rather sluggish sometimes. The previous, more affordable variation of the outdoor Nest web cam is still on sale too if you wish to save some money - it does have actually a cable attached though, instead of working wirelessly, which means it's a bit easier to screw up for prospective intruders. Definitely among the very best security cameras in 2020.</p>
