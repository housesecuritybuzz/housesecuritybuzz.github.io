<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can identify people the camera is finding utilizing face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those individuals and will send out smartphone alerts with that information when they appear at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also provide a broader series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
