<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus fraud, vandalism, and theft. You get 1080p HD streaming, a 130-degree field of view, the typical movement signals, and a 90+ dB alarm that is likely to scare off any approaching burglar before they have actually got too far into your home. When you're at home and do not want to be recorded, the privacy-conscious will be pleased to hear there's a physical shutter you can close over the camera.</p>
<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, generally described as shock sensors, are different because they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Generally, the most extreme frequencies generated are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the type of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>
