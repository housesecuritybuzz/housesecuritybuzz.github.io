<p>The Nest Camera Indoor is the third generation of the well known Dropcam-- among the very first, and one of the very best home security cameras-- and bumps up its predecessors' video quality to 1080p. It's easy to establish and, thanks to its magnetic, rotating base, it can be installed nearly anywhere indoors.

However to actually utilize the camera's features, you'll need to pay out $10 or more each month for the Nest Aware program, which offers you access to cloud storage, individual detection and adjustable activity zones.</p>
<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear video in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see in the evening. If recording footage in the dark is a top priority, make sure your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>
