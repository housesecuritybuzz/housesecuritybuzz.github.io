It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between individuals and basic motion.
