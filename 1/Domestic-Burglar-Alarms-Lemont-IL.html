<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely typical given that the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once customers recognize that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
