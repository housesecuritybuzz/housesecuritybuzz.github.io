<p>A tight wire border security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to detect any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to overlook things that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is set up to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
