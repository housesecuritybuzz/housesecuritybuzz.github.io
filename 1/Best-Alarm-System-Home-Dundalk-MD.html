<p>Nevermind how excellent the cameras are. The first question you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your information to 3rd party companies? I've dumped my Nest Cams considering that they were purchased by Google. Something all of us require to consider. Sirens. So your camera has actually identified trespassers or wild animals.

The second number informs you how resistant the camera is to moisture and varies from 0 (no protection) to 9 (safeguarded against close quarters, high pressure spray downs from all angles).</p>
